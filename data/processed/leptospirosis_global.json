        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a relatively common tropical disease that can present with multiorgan failure. Given its wide range of phenotypes, leptospirosis patients presenting with cardiac and renal failure may benefit from diuresis and decongestion. Estimating left atrial pressure and its surrogates, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) can help guide decongestive and hemodynamic therapy in these patients. A novel component of POCUS assessment, portal vein pulsatility, can provide information on end-organ congestion and aid in the titration of hemodynamic interventions.",

        "abstract": "The case-fatality rate of severe leptospirosis can exceed 50%. This retrospective cohort study examined 111 individuals with laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis admitted to Cairns Hospital, a referral hospital in tropical Australia, between January 2015 and June 2024. We examined the patients' demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging findings at presentation and then correlated them with the patients' subsequent clinical course. Severe disease was defined as the presence of pulmonary haemorrhage or a requirement for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The patients' median (interquartile range) age was 38 (24-55) years; 85/111 (77%) were transferred from another health facility. Only 13/111 (12%) had any comorbidities. There were 63/111 (57%) with severe disease, including 56/111 (50%) requiring ICU admission. Overall, 56/111 (50%) required vasopressor support, 18/111 (16%) needed renal replacement therapy, 14/111 (13%) required mechanical ventilation and 2/111 (2%) needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Older age-but not comorbidity-was associated with the presence of severe disease. Hypotension, respiratory involvement, renal involvement and myocardial injury-but not liver involvement-frequently heralded a requirement for ICU care. Every patient in the cohort survived to hospital discharge. Leptospirosis can cause multi-organ failure in otherwise well young people in tropical Australia; however, patient outcomes are usually excellent in the country's well-resourced health system.",

        "abstract": "A killed, whole-cell vaccine was produced to induce immunity in dogs against leptospirosis. The vaccine, containing serovar Copenhageni, was produced and administered to 12 beagle dogs at both 8 and 12 weeks of age. Ten unvaccinated dogs of the same age group served as the control group. A live, virulent inoculum of <i>Leptospira</i> (1.52 × 10<sup>9</sup>-4.40 × 10<sup>9</sup> leptospires per dog) was used to challenge the dogs at 2 weeks (Study 1) and 14 months (Study 2) post-booster vaccination. At regular intervals, pre- and post-challenge (PC), the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was performed to measure antibody titers. Leptospiremia and leptospiruria were determined via culture, and the cytokine, biochemical, and pathological profiles of vaccinates and controls were also assessed. A high antibody response was measurable after booster administration. In Study 1 (onset of immunity), acute leptospirosis was observed in five (100%) out of five unvaccinated dogs. In contrast, no acute clinical leptospirosis developed in vaccinated dogs, except in one (20%) dog with mild clinical signs. In Study 2 (duration of immunity), mild clinical signs were observed in two (40%) of the control dogs, while all vaccinated dogs remained clinically normal. The incidence of leptospiruria and leptospiremia PC was lower in the vaccinated dogs compared to the unvaccinated group. Severe thrombocytopenia occurred in 100% (5/5) of the unvaccinated dogs in Study 1 that exhibited acute severe leptospirosis, whereas 80% (4/5) of the unvaccinated dogs in Study 2 showed mild to moderate thrombocytopenia 3 days after challenge. Four out of five unvaccinated dogs (80%) in Study 1 exhibited icteric tissues and hemorrhages in the lungs and mucosal surfaces of the stomach and intestines. A high IL-10 to TNF-α ratio, observed in the control group of both studies, and severe thrombocytopenia observed in the control group of Study 1, indicative of acute leptospiral disease, were detected. The vaccine prevented acute clinical leptospirosis and reduced the renal carrier state in beagle dogs, and further investigation is required using a larger sample size.",

        "title": "Corticosteroids for treatment of leptospirosis.",
        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease caused by Leptospira spp, a zoonotic pathogen spread via contaminated soil and water. Corticosteroids have been used for the treatment or prevention of severe manifestations of disease, but the indications for their use and treatment efficacy remain uncertain. This review evaluates the existing evidence for the use of corticosteroids in leptospirosis from randomised trials. To assess the benefits and harms of corticosteroids versus no intervention, no intervention beyond standard of care, or placebo for the treatment of people with leptospirosis. Electronic searches in the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, and other resources were conducted. We searched online clinical trial registries to identify unpublished or ongoing trials, and reviewed reference lists from the identified publications for potential trials. We contacted authors of identified trials, relevant individuals, and organisations for additional information. The last search date was 10 April 2025. We considered the inclusion of randomised clinical trials of any trial design which assessed corticosteroids for the treatment of leptospirosis. We imposed no restrictions on age, sex, occupation, comorbidity of trial participants, or outcomes reported. We looked for trials assessing corticosteroids irrespective of type, route of administration, dosage, and schedule versus no intervention, placebo, or no intervention beyond standard care. We included trials meeting any of these criteria, irrespective of the manuscript's primary language. We adhered to Cochrane methodology. Data entry and analysis were facilitated by the use of the Review Manager. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and the proportion of individuals experiencing serious adverse events. The secondary outcomes were quality of life, the proportion of individuals experiencing non-serious adverse events, days of hospitalisation, and the proportion of individuals experiencing Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions. We employed the risk of bias 2 tool (RoB 2) to assess the bias risk of included trials. We used the GRADEPro software to evaluate the certainty of evidence. We presented dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD), both accompanied by their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). We applied a random-effects meta-analysis for the primary analysis and a fixed-effect model for the sensitivity analyses. Our primary outcome analyses included trial data at the longest follow-up. We analysed the outcome data regardless of the risk of bias. Four randomised trials were included in this review, with a pooled total of 253 participants. Each of the trials compared a corticosteroid (prednisolone, hydrocortisone, a combined treatment regimen of dexamethasone and prednisolone, or methylprednisolone) versus no intervention, no intervention beyond standard of care, or placebo. Participants in three trials received similarly administered co-interventions as standard of care, and had no further intervention in the fourth trial. All participants were recruited from populations presenting to general hospitals in leptospirosis endemic settings. The ages of the participants ranged from six years to 65 years. Depending on the trial, the treatment duration ranged from over four hours to seven days. All included trials were judged to have either some concerns or to be at high risk of bias. The certainty of evidence for all evaluated outcomes was judged to be very low. Quality of evidence was downgraded for risk of bias arising from the randomisation process, measurement of outcome, and selection of reporting of results; indirectness of evidence due to choice of intervention; inconsistency due to different point estimates and unexplained heterogeneity; and imprecision attributable to confidence intervals (CI) crossing clinically important thresholds, failure to meet optimal information size, or an upper/lower CI boundary more than three risk ratios. Corticosteroids compared with no intervention beyond standard of care or placebo may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.80, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%, 3 trials, 123 participants, very low-certainty evidence) and on the proportion of individuals experiencing serious adverse events (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.32 to 4.11, I<sup>2</sup> = 62%, 3 trials, 123 participants, very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. Corticosteroids compared to no intervention beyond standard of care or placebo may increase the proportion of individuals experiencing non-serious adverse events (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 18.98, 1 trial, 22 participants, very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. Corticosteroids compared to no intervention beyond standard of care or placebo may decrease the number of days of hospitalisation (MD 0.46, 95% CI -1.81 to 2.73, I<sup>2</sup> = 83%, 3 trials, 123 participants, very low-certainty of evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. Corticosteroids compared to no intervention may reduce the risk of Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction events (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.41, 1 trial, 130 participants, very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. None of the four trials assessed health-related quality of life. We have listed one trial registered as 'randomised' in studies awaiting classification because we could not identify further information. We have listed one trial in the ongoing section because trial recruitment has not yet started. Based on the very low certainty of evidence attributable to our analyses, we do not know whether corticosteroids compared with no intervention, no intervention beyond standard of care, or placebo, reduce all-cause mortality, increase the risk of serious or non-serious adverse events, decrease days of hospitalisation, or decrease the proportion of people experiencing Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction events. None of the four trials assessed health-related quality of life. There is a lack of harmonised treatment strategies, clinically relevant outcome definitions, and definitive and rigorously designed randomised trials to support the use of corticosteroids for leptospirosis. Future research should focus on these evidence gaps.",

Though there is no specific therapy for JE, many etiological agents of AES are treatable. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the AES cases for their etiologies, laboratory parameters, and associated clinical manifestations. A hospital-based prospective observational study was carried out, enrolling all consecutive cases of AES satisfying the World Health Organization (WHO) definition.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were processed by Gram staining, India ink staining for <i>Cryptococcus</i>, Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and culture for other bacteria and fungi<i>.</i> Serum and CSF samples lacking the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) IgM were processed for the detection of other etiologies. The CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to detect <i>Enterovirus</i>, <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>, <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i>, and herpes simplex virus, and serum IgM enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) detected scrub typhus, <i>Leptospira</i>, dengue, chikungunya, and West Nile antibodies. Out of 395 AES cases tested, 77 were found to be positive for non-JE etiologies. Of these, dengue virus (n=32/371; 8.6%) was the most common, followed by scrub typhus (n=16/348; 4.6%) and <i>Leptospira</i> (n=10/362; 2.8%). Positive cases showed CSF pleocytosis (>5 WBC/cumm) and significantly higher protein level (n=6/11; 55%) and sugar level (n=8/11; 73%) in <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae.</i> All cases presented with fever (n=11/11; 100%), followed by altered mental status (n=18/19; 94.7%) and seizure (n=22/32; 68.7%). The number of non-JE causes of AES in Assam is higher. Scrub typhus, dengue virus, and <i>Leptospira</i> are other major infectious etiologies of AES that are treatable. Timely diagnosis of such cases will help reduce AES-related complications and mortality.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is a transient response that occurs within 24 hours of antibiotic treatment for spirochete infections, such as syphilis, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, and relapsing fever, and can present with nausea, fever, chills, rigors, vomiting, hypotension, and skin lesions. This report describes the case of a 51-year-old woman who was working clearing land, with confirmed leptospirosis, who developed transient fever and hypotension following treatment with ceftriaxone (Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction). CASE REPORT A 51-year-old Japanese woman was admitted with fever and chills for 3 days. Two months prior, she had engaged in land clearance and drinking river water. She reported difficulty moving and joint pain but showed no signs of arthritis or spinal tenderness. Conjunctival injection was observed, and insect bites were absent. Laboratory findings indicated elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level, liver dysfunction, and acute kidney injury. Suspecting leptospirosis and rickettsial infections, ceftriaxone (2 g every 24 hours) was initiated, but 3 hours thereafter, the patient developed chills, fever, and hypotension. Vasopressor administration proved insufficient, necessitating intubation and transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Echocardiography findings ruled out cardiogenic shock. Despite a suspicion of septic shock, antibiotics were not escalated owing to a strong clinical suspicion of JHR. The patient's condition improved within 15 hours of antibiotic therapy. Vasopressors were discontinued on hospitalization day 3, and she was extubated. After completing ceftriaxone therapy (7 days), she was discharged on day 9. CONCLUSIONS This report shows the importance of taking a detailed clinical history for patients at risk of exposure to spirochete infections, and highlights the association between antibiotic treatment and the occurrence of transient symptoms that can mimic episodes of parasitemia or sepsis.",

The manifestations are ranged from mild febrile illness to severe conditions, including Weil's disease and rhabdomyolysis-induced acute kidney injury. Here we report a case of a 27-year-old Iranian male patient with a history of mountain climbing who developed severe leptospirosis. The patient presented massive rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and respiratory distress, initially suspected to be related to his physical activity. The leptospirosis infection was confirmed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Despite hydration and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, the patient's condition demanded intensive care and hemodialysis. Finally, the patient recovered completely, underscoring the critical need for timely diagnosis and intervention in leptospirosis cases. To date, there have been no reports of leptospirosis-associated rhabdomyolysis in Iran. Additionally, cases of rhabdomyolysis caused by leptospirosis are rare worldwide.

        "abstract": "Epidemic-prone infectious diseases (EPIDs) such as dengue fever, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), leptospirosis, Marburg virus disease, measles and cholera, to name a few, place a significant burden on the Tanzanian population and health system. Clinicians working in primary health facilities (PHFs), such as dispensaries, health centres, and basic hospitals, play a vital role in detecting cases and outbreaks. However, they often face challenges, including insufficient knowledge of these diseases and a lack of supporting resources, including surveillance guidelines, standard case definitions, and, most importantly, access to confirmatory diagnostic tests. Although Tanzania reports outbreaks of infectious diseases almost every year, a significant number of cases go undetected and contribute to delayed response and recurrent outbreaks. Smartphone-based clinical diagnostic decision support systems (CDSS) have been proven to help bridge case detection gaps. The Epidemiological Surveillance for Infectious Diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa (ESIDA) project proposed developing the ESIDA app, a smartphone-based CDSS, to aid clinicians in the detection of EPIDs. Before developing the app, the ESIDA project evaluated its acceptability among clinicians, the primary target users. The aim was to gather insights to inform the app development, ensuring its design and features are relevant and applicable in Tanzania context. In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 clinicians, including medical doctors and clinical officers from public and private facilities in the Dar es Salaam region, which has reported frequent outbreaks of dengue and cholera. Data were collected and analyzed using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Clinicians were positive about the proposed ESIDA app and intended to use it once it was available. The facilitators and barriers to acceptability focused on performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence. Expected benefits, ease of use, and government involvement emerged as facilitators of acceptability, while high internet costs, workload, time constraints, infrastructure gaps, and patient resistance were identified as potential barriers. The development of the ESIDA app should prioritize maximizing system performance and benefits. They must also be user-friendly and in line with social norms. The necessary infrastructure must be in place for effective implementation.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infectious disease of growing importance in both human and veterinary medicine. Gram-negative spirochetes of <i>Leptospira</i> are traditionally classified into serovars based on their antigenic identity, which must be ascertained to design effective treatment procedures for humans and appropriate vaccination strategies in pets and livestock. Unfortunately, identifying <i>Leptospira</i> serovars is challenging and currently requires access to a wide panel of reference strains, animal-derived antisera, or monoclonal antibodies. Here, we describe a new method for the identification of <i>Leptospira</i> serovars that is based on monosaccharide composition analysis of the polysaccharide part of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structures. Our approach requires no animal sacrifice and can be implemented in any laboratory equipped for chromatographic analysis. An LPS sugar fingerprint that is specific to each bacterial isolate that we studied can be generated. Importantly, sugar profiling of LPS enables distinguishing <i>Leptospira</i> serovars that are antigenically very similar. Using our new approach, we discover that the LPS structures of two cattle pathogens belonging to two different species: <i>Leptospira interrogans</i> and <i>Leptospira borgpetersenii</i>, and to one serovar: Hardjo, can be distinguished despite sharing major similarities. Through extensive phylogenetic analysis, we reveal which specific glycosyltransferases of the LPS biosynthesis <i>rfb</i> locus likely drove the emergence of these similarities and identify a single glycosyltransferase that might have contributed to the formation of saccharide differences in the LPS structure. Our findings have implications for future work on the evolution of bacterial polysaccharide synthesis and highlight the importance of preventing horizontal gene transfer between pathogenic bacteria.",

The objective of this study is to assess the healthcare provider's cost of managing leptospirosis at the District General Hospital, Monaragala, Sri Lanka. A hospital-based cost estimation study was conducted in DGH Monaragala using the scenario building technique, to assess the provider cost of laboratory confirmed leptospirosis patients using three standard management profiles as uncomplicated ward treated, complicated ward treated and ICU treated. The provider cost per uncomplicated leptospirosis patient treated in the ward was Rs. 5,449.39 per day (Rs. 5,993 with 10% inflation), totaling Rs. 21,797.54 for an average 4-day stay (Rs. 23,976 with inflation). For complicated cases, the cost per day was Rs. 5,695.35 (Rs. 6,264 with 10% inflation), with a total of Rs. 39,867.43 for an average 7-day stay (Rs. 43,853 with inflation). ICU costs varied by complication: renal (Rs. 26,538.79/day), cardiac (Rs. 28,212.39/day), pulmonary (Rs. 29,657.10/day), neurological (Rs. 26,444.85/day), and multi-organ failure (Rs. 28,363.17/day). The total provider cost for laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis cases at DGH Monaragala was Rs. 7,916,564.52, with 34.7% allocated to managing 11 complicated ICU cases. The provider cost of leptospirosis in DGH Monaragala was high. Given the inherent challenges in limiting exposure, it is imperative that control efforts prioritize early detection and treatment.",

Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has been used as salvage therapy for severe leptospirosis complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Current knowledge in this field is limited, with no standardized treatment approaches. We aim to describe the literature to date on the use of ECLS in patients with leptospirosis, highlighting associations, outcomes, and complications. We report on the successful use of ECLS in two cases of severe leptospirosis and conduct a narrative review of the literature. Using a search strategy developed in consultation with a medical librarian and validated across pre-selected articles, several databases were searched. We included case reports, case series, cohort studies, and prospective studies of adult patients with confirmed leptospirosis undergoing ECLS. Editorials, surveys, or opinion articles without primary patient data were excluded. Overall mortality was our primary outcome. Two cases of previously healthy males presenting with ARDS due to leptospiral infection are described. Literature review identified 25 articles containing 43 reported cases of patients treated with ECLS for severe leptospirosis. Patients were mostly young and male. Overall mortality was 16%. The most common complication recognized was acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy. Additional complications included diffuse intravascular coagulation, necrotizing pancreatitis, and limb ischemia. Leptospirosis should be considered in patients with epidemiologic exposure(s) presenting with critical illness, including ARDS and MSOF. ECLS is a viable rescue strategy in severe leptospirosis, even with established MSOF.",

        "abstract": "To describe the epidemiological changes in leptospirosis incidence from 2013 to 2022, and to further quantify factors associated with leptospirosis mortality in Thailand. We analyzed the epidemiological trends of leptospirosis incidence using data from the National Disease Surveillance System from January 2013 to December 2022 and estimated potential factors associated with leptospirosis mortality using a multiple logistic regression model. A total of 25,006 cases were reported during the study period, with an average incidence rate of 3.8 cases per 100,000 population. The incidence rate gradually decreased from 2013 to 2021, followed by a sharp increase in 2022. The case fatality rate increased steadily from 2013 to 2015 and then began to decline after 2015. A higher incidence rate was observed in men than in women, in individuals aged ≥15 years than in children <15 years, in residents of rural areas than urban areas, in people living in the southwestern region than in those living in other regions, and in individuals engaged in agriculture. We also observed that age groups, regions of residence, healthcare facilities and services, and duration from symptom onset to treatment initiation were significantly associated with a mortality risk from leptospirosis. A decreasing trend in leptospirosis incidence was observed from 2013 to 2021, followed by a recent increase in 2022, indicating that it is crucial to enhance the current surveillance system for implementing targeted interventions and to develop appropriate guidelines for reducing leptospirosis incidence and mortality by controlling the associated prognostic factors.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a globally prevalent zoonotic acute infectious disease that can rapidly progress to severe pulmonary form of leptospirosis (SPFL), leading to multiple organ failure with a high mortality rate. It is estimated that approximately 58,900 deaths occur annually due to leptospirosis, with critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units facing extremely high fatality rates. Therefore, timely and effective treatment strategies are crucial. Two patients developed fever after farm work exposure, followed by progressive dyspnea and hemoptysis, leading to hospitalization. They rapidly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) with severe thrombocytopenia, accompanied by a continuous decline in the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO₂/FiO₂ [P/F]). Despite endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, hypoxemia persisted. Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was initiated to provide oxygenation support, heparin anticoagulation was not used in the early stage. Meanwhile, prone ventilation and bronchoscopy alveolar lavage were performed to promote the clearance of pulmonary hemorrhage, along with anti-infection treatment. The diagnosis of leptospirosis was confirmed through Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS). Both patients ultimately recovered, were successfully weaned from life support, discharged in stable condition, and returned to normal life. Early VV-ECMO support, combined with prone ventilation and bronchoalveolar lavage, can improve the prognosis of patients with SPFL. mNGS testing aids in the definitive diagnosis of leptospirosis and provides a reliable basis for antibiotic selection.",

        "abstract": "Severe leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with a global distribution, which can be severe, requiring intensive care management due to its potential for multi-organ dysfunction. This case report describes a 57-year-old male patient with a history of alcohol abuse, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, who presented with severe leptospirosis. The patient exhibited symptoms including generalized myalgia, abdominal pain, vomiting, and jaundice. Initial laboratory results revealed significant abnormalities, such as elevated liver enzymes, high bilirubin levels, and severe thrombocytopenia. Despite broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required admission to the intensive care unit. Organ support interventions included mechanical ventilation with protective strategies, prone positioning, and continuous renal replacement therapy. The patient's condition was further complicated by an anuric state, delaying confirmation of leptospirosis through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Empiric treatment with ceftriaxone and corticosteroids was initiated, leading to gradual clinical improvement. The patient was extubated after 13 days but developed severe critical illness-related myopathy, which led to prolonged hospital admission, but eventually made a full recovery. This case highlights the importance of timely diagnosis and intervention in severe leptospirosis, emphasizing the role of intensive care management in improving patient outcomes. Further research is needed to establish standardized treatment protocols for severe leptospirosis, particularly concerning antimicrobials and corticosteroids.",

        "abstract": "Early differentiation between severe multi-inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and severe presentations of dengue, scrub typhus, and other endemic tropical infections could help clinicians devise appropriate treatment strategies. This study aims to identify the diagnostic markers that may be used to discriminate between MIS-C versus endemic tropical infections, namely dengue and scrub typhus, which frequently occur in endemic areas. A retrospective study was conducted in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary care center in New Delhi, India between 2020 and 2023. Comparative analysis of 33 children diagnosed with MIS-C was done versus 77 children with five endemic tropical infections-dengue, scrub typhus, typhoid fever, malaria, and leptospirosis. Rash [63.63% vs. 31.64% (P = 0.005)], conjunctival redness [63.63% vs. 8.86% (P < 0.001)], and altered sensorium [45.45% vs. 22.78% (P = 0.031)] were seen in a greater proportion of MIS-C cases than those with tropical infections. C-reactive protein (CRP) (mg/dl) was significantly higher in children with MIS-C versus those with tropical infections [176.1 (112.61, 198.32) vs. 9.25 (24.05, 69.38), P ≤ 0.001]. Ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were observed to be significantly higher in children with tropical infections compared to those with MIS-C. Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, the odds of having a rash were higher among children with MIS-C than those with dengue [OR = 8.07 (95% CI: 1.22-53.48, P = 0.03)]; followed by altered sensorium [OR = 16.04 (95% CI: 2.06-124.62, P = 0.008)]; myocardial involvement [OR = 7.18 (95% CI: 1.12-45.93, P = 0.037)]; and CRP (>50 mg/dl) [OR = 17.59 (95% CI: 2.69-114.92, P = 0.003)]. The findings of our study suggest that several clinical and laboratory measures could potentially distinguish between patients with severe MIS-C and endemic tropical infections. Clinical markers such as rash, altered sensorium, myocardial involvement, and shock were seen in a greater proportion of cases with MIS-C. Inflammatory markers such as CRP were higher in children with MIS-C, whereas ferritin and LDH were higher in dengue, scrub typhus, typhoid fever, malaria, and leptospirosis.",

A 49-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil, was hospitalized with acute abdominal pain, low blood pressure, and jaundice. He had a history of contact with floodwater and ingestion of contaminated water, was hospitalized with acute abdominal pain, low blood pressure, and jaundice. Upon ICU admission, he developed jaundice, acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, and alveolar hemorrhage necessitating intubation. Leptospirosis was confirmed by serological tests and treated with ceftriaxone for 14 days. Two weeks later, he developed severe enterorrhagia, requiring a massive transfusion and a total colectomy with terminal ileostomy. Histopathology revealed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with hyphae indicative of mucormycosis. He was treated with amphotericin B for 7 weeks, followed by posaconazole. Abdominal CT scans over the next five months showed complete clinical and radiological improvement.

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a zoonosis of global distribution. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has designated leptospirosis a nationally notifiable disease. There is need to raise awareness of the burden of leptospirosis among health care givers and policy makers in Africa. The aim of this review was to highlight the current situation of leptospirosis in Africa and suggest a One Health approach of addressing its status as a leading zoonosis. In tropical regions, the nonspecific symptoms of fever, myalgia and arthralgia result in misdiagnosis of leptospirosis with malaria, yellow fever, typhoid fever, dengue fever, brucellosis, rickettsiosis, and babesiosis. Urinalysis presents an inexpensive diagnostic aid for leptospirosis. Humans with leptospirosis exhibit proteinuria, glucosuria, pyuria, haematuria and granular casts resulting from acute kidney injury. Therapeutic guidelines for empirical treatment of febrile patients should be considered. Febrile patients who test negative for malaria and yellow fever can benefit from doxycycline, which also treats brucellosis, rickettsiosis and typhoid fever. Control of leptospirosis should also address Leptospira infection in domestic animal reservoirs through vaccination of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and dogs in endemic areas. Treatment of sick animals with streptomycin eliminates the carrier status, curbing leptospiruria and spread of infection. Rodents are important in transmission of Leptospira to humans in urban slums and rural settings therefore rodent control strategies help in reducing transmission of leptospirosis. Indirect transmission of Leptospira occurs through contact with water, vegetation, or soil contaminated with infected urine. Drinking water should be drawn from protected sources or chlorinated before household use.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a zoonosis of global importance with a wide array of clinical outcomes. The clinical course of leptospirosis varies from an undifferentiated mild febrile illness to multiorgan dysfunction and death. Severe leptospirosis requires input from multiple specialties and management in the intensive care setting. Predicting severe disease manifestations early during the course of illness helps to triage patients to appropriate treatment settings, which greatly improves the outcome. A narrative literature search was conducted by searching for relevant articles including cohort studies, experimental studies, case-control studies and cross-sectional analyses published on leptospirosis disease severity. Studies have identified clinical parameters such as dyspnoea, oliguria, hypotension and icterus in isolation or in combination to be useful in predicting severe disease manifestations of leptospirosis. In addition, laboratory (haematological and biochemical) parameters, immunological, vascular endothelium-related markers and selected microRNAs have been identified as potential markers of severe disease in leptospirosis. Even though none of the markers are validated as severity predictors to date, patient characteristics such as age, haematological and biochemical parameters are potential predictors of severe leptospirosis that could be utilised in resource poor settings. A wide array of clinical parameters and laboratory markers have been identified in literature as potential predictors of severe leptospirosis. Validation of these markers in appropriate settings would lead to the development of severity prediction models in the future.",

The disease has several clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic and subclinical infection to fatal and severe forms. The aim of this study was to produce a recombinant Leptospiral immunoglobulin-like surface protein-A (r-LigA) antigen of Leptospira interrogans in a prokaryotic expression system and to assess its efficacy in a mouse model. The optimal epitopes of the LigA protein were identified via bioinformatics studies. The pET32a<sup>+</sup>-LigA plasmid construct was cloned into E. coli Top10-DH5α, expressed in E. coli pLysS strains, and subjected to different IPTG concentrations at different times and temperatures. The expressed r-LigA was purified using nickel-affinity (Ni-NTA) chromatography from the insoluble fraction and reassessed by SDS-PAGE, western blotting, dot blotting, and Bradford assay. Female Balb/C mice were immunised subcutaneously with r-LigA alone or emulsified in Freund's adjuvant and subsequently boosted at 2 and 4 weeks. Specific antibody levels were evaluated by indirect ELISA. Bioinformatics analysis identified the key antigenic region of LigA spanning amino acids 852 to 1210. Colony PCR and digestion confirmed the successful transformation. Induction using 0.5 mM IPTG at 30°C for 5 h was found to be optimal. Overexpression of r-LigA under optimised conditions accumulated proteins as inclusion bodies. Purification of r-LigA under native conditions using optimised Ni-NTA yielded 1050 µg/mL protein and high immunogenicity by effectively stimulating the immune system in female Balb/C mice. These findings support r-LigA as a strong candidate for future leptospirosis diagnostic tools and subunit vaccine development.",

Conversely, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in intensive care units have refuted the positive impact of early RRT on mortality in patients with AKI and other causes of sepsis. In this emulated RCT utilizing a propensity score-weighted logistic regression performed in the two academic centers on the island of La Réunion, France, between 2010 and 2020, we evaluated the impact of the timing of RRT on a composite outcome of mortality or new-onset or worsening chronic kidney disease (CKD) within a year, in patients hospitalized with leptospirosis, Stage 3 AKI, and no immediate need for RRT. We included 295 consecutive patients with leptospirosis and Stage 3 AKI: 82 (28%) began RRT within 48 h of admission (\"early\" group), 213 (72%) did not start RRT within 48 h (\"delayed\" group). In the delayed group, 53/213 (25%) patients eventually required RRT. 59/295 patients (20%) met the primary outcome: 32 (15%) in the delayed group and 27 (33%) in the early group.

Nucleic acid amplification tests of blood provide reliable Leptospira detection in acute infections, but the requirement for skilled personnel and expensive equipment still limits their widespread use, especially in low-resource settings. We, therefore, developed a microfluidic-based PCR (mbPCR) assay to detect pathogenic Leptospira, aiming to simplify sample preparation. The PicoGene® PCR1100 device was integrated with primers and probes targeting the 16S rDNA of pathogenic Leptospira. The assay was evaluated for its ability to detect the spirochete directly in specimens, omitting the DNA purification step. Direct detection from blood samples was assessed using cultured live Leptospira interrogans strain L495 spiked into whole blood of hamsters and humans to determine the lower limit of detection. In addition, whole blood collected from the infected hamsters was examined by mbPCR. Using the mbPCR assay, live leptospires were detected at a concentration of 7.78 (95 % CI, 3.83-15.8) leptospires/µL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1 × 10² leptospires/µL in whole blood. The detection sensitivity was unaffected by the host animal species and the type of anticoagulant. Furthermore, mbPCR successfully identified the bacteria in as little as 1 µL of whole blood obtained from a hamster model of leptospirosis. Although further validation is required, this method has the potential to provide timely and straightforward point-of-care diagnostics, and is anticipated to see expanded use in developing regions.",

        "abstract": "Animal reservoir hosts that shed pathogenic leptospires represent a considerable public health risk because they lack clinical signs of illness that might prompt handling precautions. In Sri Lanka, dog ownership is widespread. Dogs reside within homes and interact closely with humans, but they also roam freely in surrounding neighbourhoods. Dogs that carry pathogenic leptospires represent a source of environmental contamination and infection of domestic and livestock animals, posing a greater public health issue. The objectives of this study were to isolate and molecularly characterise leptospires from the blood and urine of 20 apparently healthy companion dogs vaccinated for leptospirosis using a 2-serovar vaccine in Kandy, Sri Lanka. Urine and blood samples were subjected to culture for leptospires in an EMJH medium. Growth of pathogenic/intermediate-pathogenic leptospires was confirmed using nested PCR assays targeting the flaB gene of P1 and P2 Leptospira subclades. Three (15%) of 20 urine specimens and one (5%) of 20 blood cultures yielded leptospires. Phylogenetic analysis revealed L. interrogans and L. kmetyi (P1 subclade) in urine specimens and L. licerasiae (P2 subclade) in the blood. Thus, despite vaccination, dogs in Sri Lanka can shed viable pathogenic/intermediate-pathogenic leptospires, with associated public health implications.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis represents a significant threat to the health of both humans and animals. It is a disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira. The early detection of pathogenic Leptospira is an effective method for preventing a multitude of potential complications. The protected outer membrane protein (OMP) of pathogenic Leptospira, LipL41-OmpL1, was inserted into E. coli bacteria using different software for the amino acid sequence of OmpL1 and LipL41. This was done to design a recombinant fusion protein, which was then expressed to investigate immunogenicity. The selected genes were propagated and cloned as a fusion in a PET32a+ plasmid vector and expressed by Escherichia coli strain S (DE3) via a heat shock method. The evaluation was conducted using the BALB/c mouse as the laboratory animal model. The recombinant LipL41-OmpL1 protein was confirmed using the urea purification method and western blot, and its immunogenicity was evaluated by measuring the high humoral immune stimulation and antibody secretion in BALB/c mice by the ELISA method. The findings demonstrated that the animals that received both the OmpL1 and LipL41 proteins exhibited 85% immunogenicity, whereas the control group that did not receive the fusion protein demonstrated only 25% immunogenicity (P<0.001). Moreover, no evidence of infection was identified in recipients of the OmpL1-LipL41 fusion protein, indicating that this protein is safe for use. The protective effects of immunization with OmpL1 and LipL41 were synergistic, as no significant levels of protection were observed in animals immunized with OmpL1 or LipL41 alone. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of a recombinant OmpL1 and LipL41 fusion protein as a promising avenue for research in the development of vaccines and ELISA diagnostic kits for the prevention and rapid diagnosis of leptospirosis.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundThe incidence of leptospirosis, a zoonotic infection transmitted mainly by rodents, has increased in humans over the past decade in the Netherlands. Previous studies, mostly from countries with tropical climates, suggest that temperature and rainfall influence leptospirosis incidence.AimWe aimed to identify factors that could explain the increasing leptospirosis incidence in the Netherlands, including temperature and precipitation.MethodsEpidemiological data of leptospirosis cases notified from 2005 to 2023 to the national surveillance system were analysed to identify changes over the years. Negative binomial regression models were used to assess associations between weather variables and leptospirosis incidence.ResultsFrom 2005 to 2023, 1,164 cases were notified. The annual number of cases increased 2.7-fold in the period of 2019-2023 compared with 2005-2009, and the number of autochthonous cases 4.1-fold. Data from 1,158 cases were included in the analyses, and 596 (51.5%) of these cases were autochthonous. Most cases were male (n = 927; 80.1%), needed hospital treatment (n = 861; 74.4%) and acquired the infection through contact with surface water and/or soil (n = 611, 72.6%). Higher mean winter (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-1.36) and summer (IRR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.18-1.61) temperatures were significantly associated with increased leptospirosis incidence.ConclusionLeptospirosis incidence has increased over the past decades and may continue to increase due to climate change. Prevention should aim at advising the appropriate preventive measures to avoid exposure to <i>Leptospira</i> and increasing awareness about leptospirosis among clinicians to allow for timely diagnosis and treatment.",

Laboratory tests revealed elevated CRP and procalcitonin levels, direct hyperbilirubinemia and acute kidney injury. The following day he developed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with rapidly progressive respiratory failure and the need for invasive ventilation. Serological testing for <i>Leptospira</i> was positive and the diagnosis was further confirmed by PCR.With supportive measures and anti-infective therapy with ceftriaxone the patient's condition progressively improved. After 8 days of invasive ventilation he was successfully extubated.This case highlights the importance of considering a broader differential diagnosis in complex and severe disease presentations.

        "abstract": "Due to its various uses, the dynamical system is a significant research area in the field of mathematical biology. The model is first developed by applying the usual derivative with combined recovery measures of humans as well as animals for leptospirosis transmission and then converted into a generalized form of the fractal fractional sense with power law kernel, exponential law kernel, and Mittag-Leffler kernel. We verify all the fundamental characteristics of the newly developed model for the validation analysis of the system such as equilibrium points, local stability, positivity of solutions, reproductive number, and existence of a unique solution. Also, bifurcation analysis has been used for newly developed systems to observe the impact of each sub-compartment with the effect of different parameters. The results on Hyers Ulam stability are established by utilizing different kernels to observe its stable state. We used a numerical scheme based on the Lagrange polynomials for all three cases of fractal fractional derivatives having different kernels. The efficiency of the fractional operators with comparative analysis of different kernels is shown in simulation form to verify the validity and real behavior of leptospirosis transmission for humans as well as animals. he graphical explanation of our model's solution depicts the effectiveness of our techniques applied and this study helps for future predictions and developing better control strategies.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a major public health problem in humans and animals worldwide. The variable carboxy-terminal domain 7-13 of LigA (LigAc) is currently the most promising immunogen for the leptospirosis subunit vaccine. Its protective evidence was investigated in susceptible hamsters whose immunity was mostly based on the knowledge of resistant mice. The difference in immunity of these two animals might be an obstacle to successful vaccine development. The protective immunity induced by LigAc was reported to be specific antibodies while T-cell-mediated immunity has never been investigated. We reported for the first time that hamsters and mice gave dissimilar T-cell responses. Mice and hamsters were divided into 3 groups: an adjuvant plus recombinant LigAc (rLigAc) immunized, an adjuvant-injected, and a negative control group. Immunizations were done three times at 2-week intervals. The rLigAc-specific IgG antibody titers in rLigAc immunized mice and hamsters were significantly higher than in the control groups but no significant difference between the animals. The percentages of hamster CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly higher than those of mice. Mouse CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responded to rLigAc significantly higher than hamsters. Interestingly, the rLigAc significantly reduced the percentage of IFN-<sup>γ+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in mice (≅30 %) and more decrease (≅70 %) was found in hamsters. Remarkably, it also reduced considerably hamster IL<sup>-</sup>4<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (≅80 %) but an extremely low decrease in mice (≅20 %).

This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of a novel electrochemical aptasensor targeting the electron transfer flavoprotein subunit beta (EtfB) of Leptospira interrogans in clinical samples collected during the acute phase of leptospirosis. The aptasensor assay was tested using plasma samples and compared to the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), the standard reference method. To assess diagnostic performance, aptasensor results were evaluated against leptospirosis status as determined by MAT. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified a 40% decrease in electrochemical signal relative to the blank as the optimal cut-off, yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93. The assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 80%. For diagnostic concordance, aptasensor results were compared with those obtained from the reference quantitative PCR (qPCR) method. The aptasensor exhibited 100% positive agreement and 57.1% negative agreement with qPCR. Notably, in patients with high MAT titers, the aptasensor outperformed qPCR in detection rates (100% vs. 25%). These findings indicate that the aptasensor assay is a highly reliable and effective antigen-based diagnostic tool for early leptospirosis detection, making it suitable for both low- and high-prevalence settings.",

        "abstract": "Due to the lack of adequate data on the effectiveness of diagnostic methods and the ambiguous clinical symptoms that overlap with other febrile illnesses, diagnosing scrub typhus is difficult. This study aims to compare the accuracy of various investigations required for the diagnosis of scrub typhus like immunoglobulin G/immunoglobulin M (IgG/IgM) rapid test, IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from a patient's serum. This is a prospective study that includes all clinically suspected patients who visited the Outpatient Department (OPD) of Medicine and were admitted to the Medicine wards and Intensive Care Units of Rajmata Shrimati Devendra Kumari Singhdeo Government Medical College, Ambikapur, Chhattisgarh, India. The patients' samples were tested initially using the IgG/IgM rapid test, further confirmed by ELISA, and then subjected to RT-PCR for final confirmation. A total of 1,620 cases of acute undifferentiated febrile illness were tested, of which 82 tested positive for scrub typhus IgM rapid test. These 82 cases were further tested for confirmation using IgM ELISA, which showed 110 positive results. Additionally, RT-PCR was applied to all 1,620 samples using the DIAGsure Tropical Fever Panel Kit (3B BlackBio Dx Limited, Bhopal, India), resulting in 98 samples testing positive for scrub typhus. Both the ELISA and the rapid diagnostic test offer high capacity for discrimination, with sensitivity and specificity of 92.40%, 93.18%, and 99.20%, 98.17%, respectively (10.9% of cases came positive in serology which was negative in RT-PCR). It can be due to its nonspecific binding with antibodies of other febrile illnesses such as malaria, enteric fever, pulmonary tuberculosis, leptospirosis, etc. Conclusion: RT-PCR has shown excellent results with a sensitivity of >95% and specificity of >99%. Given its high sensitivity and specificity, along with clinical findings, RT-PCR is highly effective in detecting scrub typhus, especially for diagnosing early stages of the disease in cases of acute febrile illness with a duration of less than seven days. In reference labs, RT-PCR is the primary method for confirmation. This paper offers a thorough assessment of all the diagnostic tests for scrub typhus that are now accessible in a setting with limited resources, such as our north Chhattisgarh region.",

The most frequently reported infectious diseases in the context of these disasters are gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases and diseases resulting from wound infection. Epidemic outbreaks of infections such as leptospirosis or vector-borne diseases, which are usually less prevalent but whose increased incidence is closely related to this type of disasters, have also been described. These events evince the need to develop epidemiological surveillance protocols and for scientific societies to establish consensus-based guidelines for the diagnosis and therapeutic management of the most prevalent communicable diseases. This consensus document was developed by the Sociedad Española de Infectología Pediátrica (SEIP) in collaboration with the Asociación Española de Pediatría (AEP) and the Sociedad Valenciana de Pediatría (SVP) to establish recommendations for the therapeutic management of the main infectious diseases that may affect children impacted by floods, which could also be applicable to other natural disasters.",

In cattle, the clinical course varies from a subclinical-chronic infection, commonly found in adult animals, to a severe acute syndrome mostly found in calves. The present study reports an outbreak of acute leptospirosis, following favourable climacteric conditions. Seven affected farms were monitored. Clinical observations from infected animals (n = 30) revealed two distinct patterns: lactating calves experienced hyperacute courses, often culminating in death, and older animals, mainly steers, displayed signs of apathy, anorexia, icterus and haemoglobinuria. Necropsies confirmed jaundice and haemoglobinuria, aligning with a presumptive diagnosis of leptospirosis. Haematology and serology results further supported this diagnosis. Pomona and Mozdok serovars were the most prevalent (62.5%) and had the highest mean agglutination titres, 1:1160 and 1:700, respectively. Antimicrobial treatment of sick animals consisted of oxytetracycline. Chemical metaphylaxis and prophylactic measures were established to control the outbreak in cohabiting animals. Environmental factors like climate change are expected to contribute to more frequent leptospirosis outbreaks. Comprehensive serological surveys are recommended to develop region-specific control measures, emphasising the importance of vaccination as a practical and effective prophylactic measure.",

We report a rare case of total atrioventricular block induced by leptospirosis. Early diagnosis and prompt management present particular challenges. A 43-year-old Asian woman was referred from internal medicine to cardiology owing to an electrocardiogram abnormality. She complained of worsening chest discomfort 3 days earlier, accompanied by fever, nausea, and intermittent headaches. The patient appeared lethargic and jaundiced; blood pressure was 81/43 mmHg, heart rate was 41 bpm, respiratory rate was 20 times/minute, and temperature was 38.2 °C. The electrocardiogram showed a total atrioventricular block with a junctional escape rhythm of 45 bpm. Laboratory tests revealed increased renal and liver function, thrombocytopenia (98,000/µL), and positive immunoglobulin G and M anti-Leptospira. The patient was diagnosed with Weil's disease (Faine's score 32) and total atrioventricular block. The initial management involved fitting the patient with a transcutaneous pacemaker and giving dopamine 5 mcg/kgBW/minute, titrated to a target systolic blood pressure of > 90 mmHg. The patient was also scheduled to undergo temporary transvenous pacing. However, the patient died of suspected cardiogenic shock due to a deterioration in clinical condition. Leptospirosis can cause rare but fatal arrhythmias, as seen in this case of fulminant leptospirosis with total atrioventricular block. Clinicians should be vigilant and consider this potential complication in similar cases.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic disease that causes severe health complications with no approved vaccine which provide broad range protection. In this study, we have focused on LruC protein from the outer membrane of Leptospira spp. LruC protein has been considered as promising target for vaccine due to its immunogenicity and conservancy. We have identified total 13 conserved B-cell, CTL, and HTL epitopes from 22 different pathogenic Leptospira species and serovars, which were linked with 4 linkers and 3 adjuvants (HBHA, CTB, TLR4) to design 36 multiepitope vaccine constructs to study the effect of different components on vaccine effectiveness. The antigenicity, immunogenicity, and non-allergenicity of the constructs were confirmed through computational analyses. Physico-chemical properties, secondary structure, and tertiary models of the vaccine constructs were predicted and validated. Molecular docking studies were conducted with Toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4) to assess binding affinity, identifying three top vaccine candidates (HBHA-construct 6, CTB-construct 9, and TLR4-construct 12) for further investigation. Further, these candidates were successfully cloned into pVAX1 and pET30a vectors to prepare DNA and protein vaccines, respectively. Moreover, these multiepitope vaccines were tested in mice models to assess its immunogenicity. ELISA performed with antisera against vaccine antigen, as well as crude extract of pathogenic Leptospira species showed significant IgG responses, particularly in protein vaccines. Flow cytometry revealed increased IFN-γ producing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, especially in the TLR4-adjuvanted vaccine groups. The microscopic agglutination test further confirmed the specificity of the antibody response to Leptospira serovars. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of these multiepitope vaccine constructs in eliciting a robust immune response, laying the foundation for future challenge study and preclinical evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Introduction This study examined acute febrile illness (AFI) patients for several epidemiological and etiological factors. Acute febrile fever can result from various illnesses, including dengue, malaria, leptospirosis, and scrub typhus. The ranges of clinical outcomes of these cases were investigated as well. Methods This retrospective observational study was conducted from January 2023 to January 2024 for one year in the Medicine Department of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital, Datta Meghe Institute of Higher Education & Research (Deemed to be University), a tertiary care teaching medical college in Wardha District of Maharashtra in Central India. Six hundred patients with acute febrile illness who tested positive for leptospirosis, dengue, scrub typhus, and malaria were included in the study. A pre-made proforma was used to record the data. Results Out of 600 patients, 150 (25%) were dengue, malaria (62 (10.3%)), scrub typhus (45 (7.5%)) cases, and leptospirosis (41 (6.8%)) cases. In 150 cases of dengue, 63 (42%) had hepatitis as a complication at the time of presentation. Twenty-seven (43.55%) had presented with shock in 62 patients of malaria, 13 (31.71%) had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia in 41 cases of leptospira, and 13 (28.8%) had hepatitis in 45 cases of scrub typhus patients. Among 38 deaths, three (2%) died due to dengue, two (3.23%) due to malaria, one (2.44%) due to leptospirosis, one (2.44%) due to scrub typhus, and 31 (10.36%) due to acute febrile illness. Conclusion Dengue, malaria, scrub typhus, and leptospirosis were the four primary illnesses that led to AFI in hospitalized patients, with dengue being the most prevalent. Using a mix of clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory information, a pertinent action plan should be created to treat and prevent such fevers in any hospital setting.",

        "title": "[Guidelines for the vaccination of small animals - 6th edition].",
        "abstract": "Vaccination is one of the most important measures for preventing infectious diseases. The basic immunization of puppies is particularly important, because the development of robust, active immunity in the young has a positive effect on the health and constitution of the entire later life. Maternal antibodies can seriously interfere with the success of the vaccination by neutralizing the administered vaccine antigen - especially with live vaccines. The higher the levels of these antibodies, the longer they may prevent successful induction of active immunity. The level of these antibodies is usually unknown. Therefore, repeated vaccinations during the first months of life keep the time window, in which maternal antibodies have declined and no active immunity has been developed, as short as possible.In dogs, vaccinations against distemper, parvovirosis and leptospirosis are considered core vaccinations. The use of tetravalent leptospirosis vaccines is highly recommended. The attenuated live components against distemper and parvovirus should be administered to puppies in week 8, 12 and 16. Since the leptospirosis component is inactivated and is as much affected by maternal antibodies, it is sufficient to administer the leptospirosis vaccination in week 8 and 12. A vaccination against distemper, parvovirus and leptospirosis at the age of 15 months completes the basic immunization. In addition to the core components mentioned, vaccines against pathogens of the Canine Infectious Respiratory Disease Complex (CIRDC) (formerly: kennel cough complex), against canine herpes viruses, dermatophytoses, Lyme borreliosis and Leishmaniasis are approved for dogs. The use of these vaccines can be highly advisable depending on the individual risk of infection. For cats, vaccinations against panleukopenia and against feline herpes- and caliciviruses are considered core vaccinations. Kittens should be vaccinated against all three components in week 8, 12 and 16. A vaccination against all three components at 15 months of age completes the basic immunization. For cats, vaccinations against bordetella and chlamydia infections, against dermatophytoses and against infections with the feline leukemia virus are considered non-core. Immunization against feline infectious peritonitis is not recommended. Ferrets should be vaccinated against distemper. Rabies has been eradicated in Germany. The vaccination is therefore no longer considered a core vaccination. However, susceptible pets, i.e. dogs, cats and ferrets, that are moved within the EU or taken across the border to or from third countries must be vaccinated against rabies. Rabbits should be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit hemorrhagic disease.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis, caused by <i>Leptospira interrogans</i>, is a neglected zoonotic disease that poses a significant global health risk to both humans and animals. The rise of antimicrobial resistance and the inefficacy of existing vaccines highlight the urgent need for new preventive strategies. An immunoinformatics approach was employed to design a multi-epitope subunit vaccine (MESV) against leptospirosis. B-cell, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), and helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes were selected from five key <i>Leptospira</i> proteins. These epitopes were fused with a heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA) adjuvant and appropriate linkers to construct the broad-spectrum vaccine. The physicochemical properties of the vaccine were assessed, including antigenicity, immunogenicity, allergenicity, and conservation. The vaccine's 3D structure was modeled, optimized, and validated. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and MM-GBSA analysis were performed to assess the vaccine's binding interactions with Toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4). Immune simulations and <i>in silico</i> cloning were also conducted to evaluate the vaccine's immune response and expression potential. The MESV demonstrated high antigenicity, immunogenicity, non-allergenicity, and conservation across different <i>Leptospira</i> strains. Population coverage analysis revealed that T-cell epitopes significantly interacted with HLA molecules, covering 95.7% of the global population. Molecular docking showed strong and stable binding with TLR2 and TLR4, with binding energies of -1,357.1 kJ/mol and -1,163.7 kJ/mol, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations and MM-GBSA analysis confirmed the stability of these interactions and accurately calculated the intermolecular binding free energies. Immune simulations indicated robust B and T cell responses, and <i>in silico</i> cloning demonstrated that the vaccine could be successfully expressed in <i>E. coli</i>. These findings suggest that MESV is a promising candidate for leptospirosis prevention, providing robust immune responses and broad population coverage. However, further <i>in vivo</i> studies are necessary to validate its efficacy and safety.",

        "abstract": "Acute febrile illnesses (AFIs) with thrombocytopenia, such as dengue, leptospirosis, and scrub typhus, are often associated with bleeding and present challenges in transfusion therapy during outbreaks. Conventional bleeding predictors, which involve platelet counts, do not assess clot strength or fibrinolysis defects and may lead to inappropriate or delayed transfusions. To predict bleeding, we aimed to create a scoring system using point-of-care thromboelastography (TEG) and other conventional coagulation parameters. In this prospective cohort study, patients with AFI and platelet counts <100,000/cu mm who presented to the emergency department were recruited, and samples were collected for conventional coagulation tests and TEG analysis at admission. Patients were monitored for 48 hours for bleeding events, blood product transfusions, and mortality within 7 days. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted for significant predictors identified in univariate analysis, and a scoring system was generated using stepwise logistic regression. Sixty-six patients were recruited, including 38 with dengue and 11 with leptospirosis. Nineteen patients experienced a bleeding event within 48 hours. Dyspnea and elevated aspartate transaminase levels were more prevalent among those who bled. Thromboelastography parameters (reaction time/maximum amplitude [R/MA]), prothrombin time, international normalized ratio (INR), and baseline platelet count were significant predictors of bleeding. A scoring system using R/MA, INR, and platelet count achieved an overall predictive accuracy of 83.3% for 48-hour bleeding, with a score ≥3 demonstrating a sensitivity of 68% and specificity of 77%. Thromboelastography in patients with dengue showed more significant coagulation abnormalities than in those with leptospirosis. Validation in larger, more homogeneous populations is necessary.",

As health care facilities in many endemic areas lack good laboratory support for the diagnosis of AFI, there is difficulty in ascertaining the causes of AFI, resulting in a delay in the initiation of treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of surveillance criteria and rapid diagnostic tests in the diagnosis of patients presenting with AFI and thrombocytopenia. Our study enrolled 225 participants presenting with AFI who fulfilled the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study was conducted in the medical wards of YMCH from January 2018 to January 2019, after obtaining institutional ethics clearance. The patients were selected according to the inclusion criteria after obtaining informed consent. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS v23.0 operating on Windows 10 to determine the diagnostic characteristics, such as sensitivity and specificity of surveillance criteria and rapid diagnostic tests. Our study enrolled 225 participants, with a majority (71.3%) falling within the 20-40 age range, and a significant male predominance. Around 68% of patients had a fever lasting <5 days. The clinical diagnosis was made using surveillance criteria in all 225 participants, of which 44% of cases were dengue, 35% were malaria, 12% were leptospirosis, and 7% were scrub typhus. However, when a definitive diagnosis was made using more specific tests (ELISA for dengue, leptospirosis, and scrub typhus; MP smear for malaria), it was found that 32% had dengue, 26% had malaria, 7% had leptospirosis, 5% had scrub typhus, 27% had undifferentiated fever, and 1.8% had coinfection. The overall accuracy of the surveillance criteria in diagnosing dengue is 66.37%, malaria is 76.91%, leptospirosis is 84.07%, and scrub typhus is 89.46%. This study validates the effectiveness of the surveillance case definition in identifying AFI with thrombocytopenia, demonstrating high sensitivity and moderate specificity. It should be followed by routine rapid diagnostic tests and more specific investigations to arrive at a definitive diagnosis of AFI.",

Given the high global rates of morbidity and mortality associated with this disease, there is an urgent need to explore alternative therapeutic agents to enhance treatment options. This study investigates the anti-leptospiral efficacy of several common antibiotics-penicillin G, doxycycline, ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin, as well as extracts from local herbs, Hydnophytum formicarum Jack and Boesenbergia stenophylla, against pathogenic and intermediate Leptospira strains. A broth microdilution method determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the antibiotics and herb extracts. Both herbs were extracted using four different solvents: ethyl acetate, methanol, hexane, and chloroform. The extracts were then analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify their phytochemical compounds. The results demonstrated that cefotaxime and erythromycin exhibited the highest anti-leptospiral activity, with MIC values of 0.2 µg/mL. This was followed by amoxicillin and ampicillin (0.2-0.39 µg/mL), penicillin G (0.39-3.13 µg/mL), chloramphenicol (0.78-3.13 µg/mL), and doxycycline (0.78-12.5 µg/mL). H. formicarum Jack and B. stenophylla extract extractions displayed the lowest MICs (62.5 µg/mL) for the ethyl acetate, methanol, and hexane extracts. They contained various phytochemical constituents, including some with anti-leptospiral properties. These findings indicate that different strains of Leptospira respond with varying levels of inhibition to the antibiotics and herb extracts studied. The extracts from H. formicarum Jack and B. stenophylla may have potential as anti-leptospiral drugs. However, further in-vivo studies are needed to better understand their efficacy against Leptospira.",

Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers using the Modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Statistical analyses, including prevalence and mortality estimation, sensitivity analysis were conducted using R, with heterogeneity evaluated by the I² statistic. Out of 3,982 records, 14 studies met the eligibility criteria, yielding a pooled prevalence of dengue and leptospirosis co-infection at 2.33% (95% CI: 1.41-3.46%) across 16,638 participants, with significant heterogeneity (I² = 90%). The prediction interval for co-infection ranged from 0.05 to 7.27%. The pooled mortality rate among co-infected patients was 9.96% (95% CI: 0-53.49%), with moderate heterogeneity (I² = 71%). The prediction interval for mortality ranged from 0.00 to 100%. Publication bias was indicated by an LFK index of 2.52. This meta-analysis revealed a moderate prevalence and a notable mortality rate for dengue and leptospirosis co-infections, with significant variability observed across different studies. Further research into the immunopathology and the implementation of integrated surveillance systems could enhance the effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment strategies in regions where these diseases are endemic.",

        "abstract": "The global priorities in the field of infectious diseases are constantly changing. While emerging viral infections have regularly dominated public health attention, which has only intensified after the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous bacterial diseases have previously caused, and continue to cause, significant morbidity and mortality-deserving equal attention. Three potentially life-threatening endemic bacterial diseases (leptospirosis, melioidosis, and rickettsioses) are a huge public health concern especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite their continued threat, these diseases do not receive proportionate attention from global health organizations and are not even included on the WHO list of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). This, in turn, has led to a vicious circle of neglect with continued, yet conceivably preventable, hospitalizations and deaths each year especially in the vulnerable population. This is a call from a group of multi-institutional experts on the urgent need to directly address the circle of neglect and raise support in terms of funding, research, surveillance, diagnostics, and therapeutics to alleviate the burden of these 3 diseases.",

It is globally distributed, with heightened prevalence in tropical regions. While prior studies have examined the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and risk factors of leptospirosis, few have explored trends and emerging topics in the field. This study applies bibliometric analysis to generate a visual knowledge map, identifying research hotspots and forecasting future trends in leptospirosis investigations. Data were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC), encompassing all publications up to May 1, 2024. CiteSpace and VOSViewer software were used to analyze annual publication trends, as well as contributions from countries, institutions, journals, authors, references, and keywords, thereby pinpointing current research priorities and potential future directions. A total of 5,244 articles were included, sourced from 4,716 institutions, 955 journals, and 156 countries or regions. The United States led with 1,315 publications and had the most significant influence in the field. \"PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases\" published the highest number of articles (166), while \"Infection and Immunity\" garnered the most citations (6,591). Prominent research areas included restriction endonucleases, monoclonal antibodies, outer membrane proteins, water environments, detection methods, and antimicrobial agents. Research focus has shifted from early genomic and antigenic studies to investigations into outer membrane protein functions and environmental persistence, culminating in recent advances in molecular mechanisms and diagnostic technology development. This bibliometric analysis provides a comprehensive snapshot of leptospirosis research, emphasizing collaborations and impact among authors, countries, institutions, and journals. It offers valuable insights into ongoing trends and serves as a reference for future collaboration and research opportunities in the field.",

However, little is known about the effectiveness of the currently used antibiotics against different <i>Leptospira</i> species, serovars, and strains. This review aimed to give insight into the anti-leptospiral activities of the currently available antibiotics towards <i>Leptospira</i> strains and their effectiveness in treating and preventing leptospirosis. Anti-leptospiral activities from natural resources were also reviewed. The literature search was conducted using several databases. The majority of <i>Leptospira</i> strains were sensitive to the current antibiotics. Antibiotics can accelerate the defervescence and reduced the occurrence of leptospirosis cases, nevertheless, there is no affirmative evidence on the beneficial effects of the antibiotics compared to placebo in preventing death. Adverse reactions like Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions (JHR) in patients treated with the current antibiotics were also reported. Plants, marine actinobacteria and propolis are shown as potential sources of new anti-leptospiral compounds. Although leptospirosis can still be adequately treated with current antibiotics, continuous susceptibility testing and the development of novel antibiotics especially from natural resources are highly encouraged.",

The disease's pathogenesis and epidemiology are complex networks not fully elucidated. Epidemiology reflects the One Health integrated approach of environment-animal-human interaction, causing severe illness in humans and animals, with consequent public health burdens. Saprophytic and pathogenic leptospires have been shown to form biofilms <i>in vivo</i>, <i>in vitro,</i> and in environmental samples. Biofilms are characterized by a polymeric matrix that confers protection against hostile environments (both inside and outside of the host), favoring bacterial survival and dissemination. Despite its significance, the role of this bacterial growth mode in leptospiral survival, transmission, and decreased antibiotic susceptibility remains poorly understood and underexplored. Even so, the literature indicates that biofilms might be correlated with lower antimicrobial susceptibility and chronicity in leptospirosis.

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection occurring worldwide. It is of particular public health concern due to its global distribution, epidemic potential and high mortality without appropriate treatment. The method for the management of leptospirosis, particularly in severe disease, is clouded by methodological inconsistency and a lack of standardized outcome measures. The study this protocol details aims to develop a core outcome set (COS) for leptospirosis research. A COS is a set of outcomes with international consensus as a minimum for reporting in future studies focusing on leptospirosis. Establishing a COS will contribute to harmonizing Leptospirosis treatment research and will be instrumental in constructing a high-quality evidence base to feed into a planned future rigorous international clinical trial on leptospirosis. The COS-LEP study will employ a COS development methodology standardized by the COMET initiative framework. This includes (1) a systematic review of available quantitative and qualitative literature reporting therapeutic response and safety outcomes and measures; (2) focused interviews with healthcare professional and people treated for leptospirosis exploring outcomes of interests using qualitative methodology; (3) narrowing the choice of outcomes by international consensus using a Delphi survey process; and (4) undertaking a hybrid consensus meeting with key stakeholders to build the final COS. This protocol describes the method to develop the first core outcome set for use in human leptospirosis studies. This will not only be a key feature in the design of a future definitive randomized controlled trial, but also provide a structure for clinicians and researchers collecting treatment cohort data in the various settings where leptospirosis is a public health issue.",

We studied the causes, complications and 90-day outcomes of patients with AKI at a tertiary referral centre in Sri Lanka. <b>Methods:</b> Patients aged 18 years or older with AKI referred to nephrology services were analysed retrospectively. AKI severity was assessed using the KDIGO classification. Information was gathered from hospital and clinic records. <b>Results:</b> Of the 464 patients studied, 262 (56.5%) were males. The mean age of the study sample was 57.04 (SD 16.85) years. The majority (212-45.69%) were discharged with normal renal functions, 173 (37.28%) were discharged with impaired functions, and 79 (17.03%) died during hospital stay. There were 377 patients at 3 months follow-up; 331 (87.8%) had normalised renal function, 40 (10.6%) had not recovered fully and 6 (1.6%) had succumbed. Progression of AKI to chronic kidney disease or death was significantly high in patients aged > 60 years (<i>p</i>=0.017). More severe AKI was associated with type 2 diabetes (<i>p</i>=0.0042), hypertension (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and multiple comorbidities (<i>p</i>=0.0014). Persons with no comorbidities had less severe AKI (<i>p</i>=0.0004). Even in the early stages of AKI, there was significantly high mortality (11% in AKI stages 1 and 2) which doubled in stage 3 (22%). Mortality was low in patients with prerenal causes of AKI (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.35-0.99 and <i>p</i>=0.047). <b>Conclusions:</b> AKI in elderly and comorbid patients has high morbidity and mortality. Identification of individuals who are at high risk of developing AKI is important for its prevention, early diagnosis and proper treatment.

This study focuses on assessing the antimicrobial efficacy of silver-doped zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO:9Ag) on standard Leptospira spp. strains (six species and ten serovars). Comparisons with conventional antibiotics were made. In vitro characterizations, including minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), cell viability, membrane permeability, intracellular content release, and broth microdilution checkerboard assay, evaluated streptomycin, penicillin G, doxycycline, tetracycline, and ZnO:9Ag effects on Leptospira. The safety and toxicological effects of ZnO:9Ag were explored using the chicken embryo in vivo model. All treatments displayed notable anti-Leptospira effects. Penicillin G had a lower MIC (<0.048), contrasting ZnO:9Ag's higher MIC (6.25-50 μg/mL). Despite this, ZnO:9Ag exhibited pronounced inhibitory effects, making it a viable therapeutic option. At 100 μg/mL, ZnO:9Ag reduced cell viability in 50 % of strains, notably in L. interrogans, L. kirschneri, and L. noguchii species. ZnO:9Ag induced a significant permeability change (p < 0.05) and substantial intracellular content extravasation across all species. The checkerboard method revealed a significant synergistic antibacterial effect of the ZnO:9Ag combination with doxycycline, penicillin G, streptomycin, and tetracycline against the L. interrogans species. In vivo, ZnO:9Ag differed significantly (p < 0.05) from the negative control in the GGT enzyme parameter. In conclusion, ZnO:9Ag shows promising potential as an alternative antibacterial agent against Leptospira spp., inhibiting growth with a relatively safe and low toxicity level.",

        "abstract": "A protein subunit vaccine comprising conserved surface-exposed outer membrane proteins (SE-OMPs) is considered a promising platform for leptospirosis vaccine. The search for novel vaccine candidates that confer high protective efficacy against leptospirosis is ongoing. The LIP3228 protein was previously identified as a conserved and abundant SE-OMP with the potential to serve as an effective vaccine candidate. However, it is crucial to explore the immunological properties of this vaccine antigen before proceeding with animal experiments. This study aimed to assess the immunological characteristics of LIP3228 through in silico prediction and to validate its immunogenicity and protective efficacy in a hamster model of acute leptospirosis. The LIP3228 vaccine candidate was predicted in silico to be immunogenic, with strong binding B-cell and T-cell epitopes. In the immune simulator, it demonstrated stable interactions with Toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2) and 4 (TLR4) and induced immune responses, potentially stimulating host immune responses in vivo. The animal experiment showed that immunization with recombinant LIP3228 protein, formulated with AddaVax adjuvant, induced high and specific IgG responses in hamsters, with IgG2 being the predominant subclass. Although no significant improvement in survival was observed compared to the negative control after a homologous challenge with virulent leptospires, the vaccinated hamsters showed a reduction in histopathological changes and severity of lesions in target organs compared to unvaccinated hamsters. These results suggest that the immunoinformatic prediction is effective in predicting immunogenicity but not protective efficacy. Therefore, LIP3228 could be considered a potential vaccine candidate for mitigating severe tissue damage. These findings may have significant implications for the development of subunit vaccines in the future.",

A time series regression was conducted, comparing the time variable with other national-level variables. Then, several simple linear regressions were performed. Linear regressions show the relationship between the reduction in cases and improved access to treated water and sewage collection, whereas an increase in per capita income seems to be inversely related to leptospirosis incidence. Geospatial distribution shows higher incidence in the Brazilian South and Southeast. Disease lethality varied over time but without significant change during the period.

The patient presented with persistent high fever, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, abdominal pain, and jaundice, following the consumption of street food in a resource-limited area. Important clinical findings included hepatosplenomegaly and elevated liver enzymes, which initially complicated the differential diagnosis. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of all three pathogens, presenting significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to overlapping symptoms and potential antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The main diagnoses included typhoid fever, leptospirosis, and campylobacteriosis, each requiring distinct yet coordinated treatment approaches. The patient was managed with a combination of antibiotics targeting each pathogen and supportive care to address dehydration and liver dysfunction. After a prolonged hospital stay, the patient recovered with no residual symptoms, underscoring the success of a tailored, multidisciplinary approach in the context of limited healthcare resources. This case underscores the importance of clinical awareness regarding co-infections, particularly in areas with inadequate sanitation, where infectious diseases are endemic. The successful management of this complex case highlights the necessity of rapid, accurate diagnostics and coordinated therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes in patients with multi-pathogen infections. This report also emphasizes the critical need for surveillance and tailored interventions in regions facing rising AMR, enhancing our understanding of how to approach emerging infectious diseases in underserved populations.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection caused by <i>Leptospira</i> bacteria, which is reemerging in various regions and often poses a diagnostic challenge due to its nonspecific symptoms. While most infections are mild, severe cases occur in 5-10% of patients and are associated with high mortality, especially in areas with poor sanitation and urbanization. This study aims to investigate the association of specific parameters with leptospirosis diagnosis using a machine learning model and geographic mapping tools to identify spatial patterns and high-risk areas for the disease. Methods An observational retrospective study conducted at a tertiary care center analyzed patients clinically suspected of leptospirosis over the course of one year. The study utilized laboratory investigations, geographic mapping, and machine learning models to explore the association between various laboratory parameters and the predictive diagnosis of leptospirosis. Results The study, conducted over one year at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Kalyani, India, included 325 patients, of whom 43 (13.2%) tested positive for leptospirosis by IgM ELISA. Geographic mapping revealed case clusters around nearby districts of West Bengal, with a few cases from Tripura and Bangladesh. The study found no significant association between individual laboratory parameters and leptospirosis diagnosis. However, machine learning models, particularly k-nearest neighbors (KNN), demonstrated moderate predictive accuracy (accuracy: 74%, area under the curve: 0.6). Conclusion Geographic mapping identified clusters of leptospirosis cases; however, no significant association was found between individual laboratory parameters and the disease diagnosis. Machine learning models, particularly KNN, demonstrated moderate predictive accuracy.

        "abstract": "We present a rare and challenging case of Weil's disease in a patient who was admitted to the Critical Care Unit with a clinical suspicion of the condition. The patient showed a prompt response to treatment before laboratory confirmation was obtained. Leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease, is most commonly found in tropical and temperate regions. While it is uncommon in the UK, it carries the potential for severe complications if not treated promptly. We report a 57-year-old gentleman from the North of England with no previous past medical history of note who presented with febrile illness and jaundice. His symptoms included fever, abdominal pain, and poor eating and drinking. Investigations showed raised inflammatory markers and deranged liver function tests (LFTs) with a hepatitic picture. Common causes of deranged LFTs including viral hepatitis, excessive alcohol intake, and paracetamol poisoning were excluded. In addition, CT abdomen and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed no obstructive lesions. He was admitted to the Intensive Treatment Unit (ITU) for monitoring due to impending multiorgan dysfunction. More elaborative history suggested leptospirosis, and he was treated empirically with intravenous ceftriaxone. Leptospira IgM and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) came back positive indicative of severe leptospirosis. He improved remarkably while in the ITU and was discharged to the ward and then home a few days later. In conclusion, we want to highlight leptospirosis as a cause of fulminant acute hepatitis with potential multiorgan failure and should be suspected even in urban regions when other common causes of hepatitis are excluded.",

This was a retrospective observational cross-sectional study conducted in the Department of Microbiology, NRS Medical College, from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023 in serologically diagnosed febrile patients attending the outpatient department or admitted. Clinical and epidemiological data and laboratory parameters were recorded in a pretested structured questionnaire study tool, and collected data were analysed on MS-Excel sheets with various charts and tables. A total of 1711 serologically diagnosed febrile patients showed preponderance of dengue (38.3%), followed by leptospirosis (25%), scrub typhus (23.9%), malaria (12.6%), and enteric fever (1.92%). A majority of cases were male, less than 40 years of age, and from the rural population (73.2%), except in malaria (urban = 79.6%). The mean duration of fever was 9 days. Febrile cases were recorded maximum during the monsoon and postmonsoon periods (66.5%). The common manifestations are fever, headache (46.2%), pain abdomen (7.8%), nausea, and vomiting (9.4%). Thrombocytopenia with bleeding manifestation was higher in dengue (18%) cases. Mortality in dengue cases was recorded with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Scrub typhus cases showed seizure (8.3%) and altered sensorium (5%) due to fatal meningoencephalitis. Fatality in leptospirosis was mostly due to acute kidney injury (29.5%) and Weil's disease (4.4%). Misdiagnosis or incorrect diagnosis and delay in initiation of appropriate treatment results in increased morbidity and mortality in AFI. Determination of epidemiological features and clinical manifestations of AFI along with timely correct diagnosis will benefit clinicians in proper treatment initiation, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality.",

While it is more common in males, it can occur in various contexts, including pregnancy. Leptospirosis, a zoonotic infection, can co-occur with other illnesses such as scrub typhus. We present a case of a 27-year-old primigravida in her second trimester who developed WE, presenting with altered sensorium, fever, and neurological deficits. Initial examination revealed ophthalmoplegia and confusion, with MRI confirming typical findings of WE. Investigations indicated co-infection with leptospirosis and scrub typhus, along with abnormal liver function tests. Treatment with intravenous thiamine resulted in symptomatic improvement. This case underscores the critical role of early diagnosis and treatment of WE, especially in pregnant patients with poor nutritional intake or hyperemesis gravidarum. Imaging studies, particularly MRI, enhance diagnostic accuracy. The patient's condition was exacerbated by concurrent infections affecting liver function and thiamine reserves. WE, though rare in pregnancy, should be suspected in cases of nutritional deficiency and acute illness.

        "abstract": "Pathogenic <i>Leptospira</i> species are the source of leptospirosis, a common zoonotic infection that can cause a wide range of clinical manifestations, from minor flu-like symptoms to severe multiorgan failure. We present two peculiar cases of leptospirosis; they highlight the need for clinical awareness to improve patient outcomes and further knowledge of leptospirosis epidemiology and therapy by illuminating the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. The first case involved a 30-year-old male presented with jaundice. Although he had no history of chronic illnesses, an exhaustive investigation was warranted due to his recent travel history and occupational contact. Laboratory tests revealed significantly increased levels of AST and ALT and positive <i>Leptospira</i> IgM serology. Remarkably, the patient refuted the traditional theory of leptospirosis transmission by denying direct animal interaction. After starting therapy with dexamethasone initially and adding doxycycline later, the patient's condition significantly improved; his jaundice resolved and his liver enzyme levels returned to normal. An outpatient follow-up after discharge was advised to assess liver and kidney function. The second case involved an 87-year-old woman with a fever, weakness and hypertension. Investigations revealed hepatosplenomegaly, raising the possibility of hypersplenism. She reported exposure to animals, particularly her dogs in her urban house. Surprisingly, her AST and ALT levels were normal. Lab tests also revealed thrombocytopoenia with normal APTT and prolonged PT. Serological tests indicated positive <i>Leptospira</i> IgM. Along with intravenous infusions, the patient's treatment plan comprised dexamethasone, enalapril and ceftriaxone to treat inflammation, hypertension and bacterial infection, respectively. Following a 20-day hospital stay, the patient's laboratory results and symptoms improved, leading to her discharge. Continuous follow-up recommended to monitor her recovery and prevent recurrence. These case studies emphasise the significance of taking leptospirosis into account when treating patients who do not have normal exposure histories yet present with unusual symptoms.",

Risk factors are associated with exposure and the immune response, particularly in immunosuppressed patients. A clinical case involving a 49-year-old patient with a history of splenectomy and no immunization schedule. The patient presented to the emergency room with non-specific symptoms, primarily myalgias, arthralgias, and emesis, initially suggestive of a viral infection. However, there was a rapid progression to hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring invasive ventilatory support. Given the immune status due to spleen absence, antibiotic treatment with meropenem and linezolid was promptly initiated, to mitigate the risk of post-splenectomy sepsis. During antibiotic administration, the patient experienced febrile episodes, accompanied by chills, myalgias, and emesis, which gradually decreased in both duration and intensity. Ultimately, the patient exhibited satisfactory progress, successfully underwent extubation, and completed a 7-day antibiotic course. Final reports confirmed positive IgM for Leptospira. Leptospirosis is a global zoonotic disease, displaying a diverse array of manifestations; recognized as a potential cause of undifferentiated fever, often confused with other prevalent tropical infections. The imperative to consider this diagnosis extends beyond the general population to encompass individuals in states of altered immunity. Recognizing and addressing leptospirosis in at-risk populations is crucial, as it can significantly impact the prompt initiation of treatment and, consequently, influence associated mortality rates.",

We used Thailand's national database from 2018 to 2022 to determine the case numbers of AUFIs and geographic heat maps to identify endemic areas in Thailand. The case numbers of malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, typhoid, and scrub typhus significantly decreased during phase 2 (preventive measures) (P = 0.02), and cases of malaria and leptospirosis increased during phase 3 (loosened preventive measures) (P = 0.01). In 2022, malaria and leptospirosis increased by 39% and 48%, respectively, compared with the previous year. Malaria increased in western Thailand along the border between Thailand and Myanmar, where malaria preventive measures were insufficient, whereas leptospirosis increased in northern Thailand.

The present cross-sectional study aimed to diagnose acute leptospirosis among 210 suspected dogs using microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Further, epidemiological risk factors were analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate binomial logistic regression analysis. Out of the 210 dogs, anti-leptospiral antibody was detected in 123 (58.57 %; 95 % CI: 51.6-65.3) dogs by MAT (cut-off titer- ≥1:100), among which 67 (54.47 %; 95 % CI: 45.3-63.4) were seropositive to more than one serogroup.

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is an emerging illness presenting a broad range of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic or mild cases to severe and fatal outcomes. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment; however, similar clinical presentations in various febrile illnesses or co-infections, along with challenges in laboratory diagnostics, can lead to misdiagnosis and severe consequences. Identifying clinical predictors for severe forms of the disease is essential in mitigating complications and reducing mortality. Consequently, we conducted a retrospective case-control study to identify clinical markers indicative of severe disease in leptospirosis patients from the Transcarpathian region. The study focused on patients admitted with clinically suspected leptospirosis, involving a total of 51 diagnosed cases, with 13 resulting in severe outcomes and death. Categorical variables were analyzed using χ<sup>2</sup>, revealing a mean patient age of 50 years, predominantly male (n = 36, 70.5%). Oliguria emerged as a significant independent factor associated with mortality (odds ratio [OR], 13.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.56-71.12; p = 0.001). Additionally, our analysis uncovered a noteworthy increase in leptospirosis notification rates in Transcarpathian compared to Ukraine, with 150 cases out of the total 433 in Ukraine. The highest notification rates were observed in Mukachevo District and Perechyn District. These findings highlight the importance of early recognition of key clinical markers, such as oliguria, which are critical for predicting severe outcomes in leptospirosis patients. The higher notification rates in Transcarpathian regions also underscore the need for enhanced surveillance, targeted public health interventions, and timely treatment to reduce mortality in endemic areas.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis, a globally re-emerging zoonosis caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp., poses a significant threat to public health. Leptospirosis in cats is often neglected due to its high underdiagnosis. Therefore, the role of cats in disease transmission and bacterial maintenance in the environment remains unclear. For this study, 54 serum samples, 54 urine samples and 27 EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples from pet cats presenting to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital due to health problems were used. The serum samples were tested for antibodies against 12 pathogenic serovars of Leptospira spp. using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). EDTA-anticoagulated blood and urine samples were tested for the lipL32 gene of pathogenic Leptospira spp. by conventional (PCR) and real-time (qPCR) polymerase chain reaction. Agglutinating antibodies were detected in 18.52% (10/54) of the sera with a titre range of 1:50 to 1:12800. The most common serogroup was Pomona, followed by Sejroe, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Australis and Javanica. Leptospira spp. DNA was found in 1.85% (1/54) of the urine samples, while all EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples were negative. A statistically significant difference in seropositivity regarding lifestyle was found between outdoor/indoor and indoor-only cats, while the presence of another cat in the household significantly increased the likelihood of seropositivity. Cats with immunocompromising conditions showed a significantly increased risk of seropositivity, especially those undergoing immunosuppressive treatment. In addition, respiratory signs and changes in lung structure associated with the presence of leptospiral antibodies, and these cats were more likely to be infected with the Pomona serogroup. Moreover, cats with anaemia, leucocytosis, and thrombocytopenia were significantly more likely to have antibodies against Leptospira spp., while seropositive cats had significantly lower urine-specific gravity compared to seronegative cats. The results underline the importance of raising awareness of feline leptospirosis in veterinary care and recognising pet cats as potential carriers of leptospires. Further research is needed to clarify the specific role of the Pomona serogroup as a potentially highly evolutionary drifting serogroup in terms of pathogenicity and to clarify the zoonotic potential of infected cats, which is crucial for the implementation of effective public health measures and veterinary interventions.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies demonstrated that <i>Leptospira biflexa</i>, a saprophytic species, triggers innate immune responses in the host during early infection. This raised the question of whether these responses could suppress a subsequent challenge with pathogenic <i>Leptospira</i>. We inoculated C3H/HeJ mice with a single or a double dose of <i>L. biflexa</i> before challenge with a pathogenic serovar, <i>Leptospira interrogans</i> serovar Copenhageni FioCruz (LIC). Pre-challenge exposure to <i>L. biflexa</i> did not prevent LIC dissemination and colonization of the kidney. However, it rescued weight loss and mouse survival thereby mitigating disease severity. Unexpectedly, there was correlation between rescue of overall health (weight gain, higher survival, lower kidney fibrosis marker ColA1) and higher shedding of LIC in urine. This stood in contrast to the <i>L. biflexa</i> unexposed LIC challenged control. Immune responses were dominated by increased frequency of effector T helper (CD4+) cells in spleen, as well as significant increases in serologic IgG2a. Our findings suggest that exposure to live saprophytic <i>Leptospira</i> primes the host to develop Th1 biased immune responses that prevent severe disease induced by a subsequent challenge with a pathogenic species. Thus, mice exposed to live saprophytic <i>Leptospira</i> before facing a pathogenic serovar may withstand infection with far better outcomes. Furthermore, a status of homeostasis may have been reached after kidney colonization that helps LIC complete its enzootic cycle.",

With an increase in Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccination, the etiology of AES is also changing. However, most studies on AES in India have focused only on children and on JEV. This study was conducted in the Department of Medicine, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University between 2020 and 2022 to determine the etiology of AES in adults. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected from patients 18 years or older with fever and altered sensorium for ≤15 days. We did IgM ELISA for dengue, chikungunya, West Nile virus, scrub typhus, leptospirosis from serum, CSF-IgM for JEV, and CSF-polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, enterovirus, and cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) for tuberculous meningitis (TBM). The most common cause of AES identified in our study was TBM (16.7%), followed by leptospirosis (15.1%) and scrub typhus (11.9%). The high occurrence of TBM in our study highlights the importance of CSF-CBNAAT for all AES patients. As leptospirosis and scrub typhus are easily treatable, early detection and treatment of these infections should be recommended.",

        "abstract": "Terrestrial and aquatic environments contaminated with animal urine may contribute to the transmission of Leptospira, a causative agent of leptospirosis in humans and wild/domesticated animals. Although enormous amounts of work have been done decoding the ecophysiology, the factors governing the cell growth and virulence in Leptospires derived from environmental samples still remain elusive. Here, we show oxidation of a wide array of organic acids including acetoacetate by a new strain of Leptospira interrogans designated as KeTo, isolated from a sewage sample originating from a wildlife enclosure located at Mangalore, India. We further demonstrate the susceptibility of KeTo to ethyl ester of acetoacetate (ethyl acetoacetate, EA). A 4.7 Mbp genome of KeTo shared the highest relatedness to pathogenic L. interrogans RGA<sup>T</sup> (99.3%), followed by L. kirschneri 3522C<sup>T</sup> (91.3%) and other related species of Leptospira (80.8‒74.3%), and harbored genes encoding acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase and acetoacetate decarboxylase respectively involved in the acetoacetate utilization and acetone formation. In line with this, strain KeTo oxidized acetoacetate when supplied as a sole carbon. Aqueous EA suppressed biofilm formation (p < 0.0001) of KeTo in basal Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) medium. Similarly, significant inhibition in the growth/biofilm of Leptospira was recorded in semisolid EMJH with/without blood supplementation when exposed to volatile EA. The extent of ketone body oxidation and susceptibility to EA was found to vary with strain as evident through the analysis of L. interrogans serogroup Australis sv. Australis strain Ballico and L. interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae sv. Lai Like strain AF61. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the ketone body metabolic ability and susceptibility to an esterified derivative of a major ketone body in the tested strains of L. interrogans. Molecular aspects governing EA-driven growth inhibition warrant further investigations to develop optimal therapeutics for leptospirosis.",

More specific molecular tests are not easily accessible for diagnosis of these diseases, thus resulting in delayed diagnosis and eventually considerable morbidity and mortality. We report a case of leptospirosis with tick-borne typhus coinfection in an abattoir worker who presented with a short history of fever, myalgia, jaundice, nonoliguric renal failure, diffuse petechial rash, and altered sensorium. His lab investigations showed leukocytosis, raised C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated transaminases and creatinine, mild pleocytosis, and mildly raised proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Serology for <i>Leptospira</i> IgM was positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A paired Weil-Felix test (WFT) showed a fourfold increase in OX19 and OX2 titers. The patient responded well to IV antibiotic therapy and was discharged. This is the first time that leptospirosis and Indian tick-borne typhus coinfection has been reported from western India. Leptospirosis and Indian tick-borne typhus coinfection is a rare but important cause of tropical fever.

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic disease with high health and economic damage. In this study, we developed a deterministic mathematical model that describes the dynamics of leptospirosis transmission within a cattle herd, incorporating asymptomatic infected and vaccinated compartments. The study examined the transmission role of asymptomatic cattle that contaminate herds without farmers' knowledge. We proved the well-posedness of the proposed model and found the basic reproduction number using the next-generation matrix. Analytically, we demonstrated that the disease-free equilibrium point is locally and globally asymptotically stable when <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mi>R</mi> <mn>0</mn></msub> </math> is less than unity and is otherwise unstable. Graphically, we further established the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria. Sensitivity analysis showed that the contact rate with asymptomatic infected cattle, <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mi>β</mi> <mi>A</mi></msub> </math> , is the most sensitive parameter in the stated model, followed by the recovery rate of asymptomatic infected cattle, <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>σ</mi></math> , and the vaccination rate of susceptible cattle, <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>τ</mi></math> . Numerical simulations revealed that a reduction in contact rate with asymptomatic infected cattle significantly reduced pathogen Leptospira transmission in the herd. In addition, fostering the recovery rate of asymptomatic infected cattle can significantly reduce new infections in the herd. Furthermore, augmenting the vaccination rate among susceptible cattle resulted in a notable decrease in disease prevalence within the herd. Findings of this study underscore the remarkable importance of targeted interventions, such as reducing contact rates with asymptomatic infected cattle, increasing recovery rates using proper treatments, and enhancing vaccination efforts to manage leptospirosis transmission in cattle herds.",

Timely initiation of dialysis in AKI is fundamental to achieve treatment goals and to provide solute clearance and removal of excess fluid while awaiting the recovery of kidney function. The primary outcome of interest of the study was recovery of sufficient kidney function to discontinue haemodialysis therapy and complete recovery of renal function. This prospective observational study has been conducted in Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh from September 2019 to February 2021. All adult patients with AKI-D were included in the study. All patients were followed up till death or complete recovery or for a maximum period of six month. A total of 134 patients of AKI-D were included in the study with the mean age of 42.3±15.7 years. Male (54.5%) were slightly more than female with a male to female ratio of 1.2:1. Diabetes and hypertension were present in 16 (11.9%) and 47 (35.1%) patients respectively. The causes of AKI were sepsis (35.1%), urinary tract infection (34.3%), acute watery diarrhoea (9.7%), leptospirosis (11.2%), obstetric (10.4%), malignancy (8.2%), post renal obstruction (8.2%), drugs (7.5%), surgery (18.7%), rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (6%), COVID 19 (5.2%), rhabdomyolysis (4.5%), intestinal obstruction (3.7%), acute gastroenteritis (2.2%), wasp bite (2.2%), insecticide poisoning (1.5%), star fruit toxicity (1.5%), haemolytic uremic syndrome (0.7%) and unknown (1.5%). Mean number of dialysis requirement was 5.9±8.6 and length of hospital stay was 15.4±10.5 days. Out of 134 patients, 95(70.9%) were discharged from hospital and 39(29.1%) died in hospital. Total death of patients during the study period were 49(36.6%) including home death of 10(7.5%) patients. Complete recovery of kidney function was achieved in 70(52.2%) patients and partial recoveries of kidney function who can survive without dialysis were observed in 12(9%) patients. Three (2.2%) patients remain on dialysis and 85(63.4%) patients survived during the study period. Survival rate was significantly higher in patients with ≤40 years (72.6%) and significantly lower in patients with malignancy (18.2%) and post renal obstruction (27.3%). Outcomes of patients with AKI-D remain poor. Advanced stage of AKI, older age, late presentation, malignancy, nutritional deficiency and delay at initiation of dialysis were associated with high mortality and reduced survival.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by the pathogen Leptospira. The disease is primarily transmitted through contact with animals (mainly rats) or through exposure to contaminated water or soil. Underdeveloped countries and places with poor housing and sanitation are at higher risk. Leptospirosis often presents with nonspecific symptoms, making it difficult to diagnose. This can delay the initiation of appropriate treatment. In the case presented, the patient had a history of cough, high fever, and a rash over various parts of the body. This combination of respiratory symptoms, systemic fever, and dermatological manifestations led to the suspicion of an infection. Initial blood examinations revealed a significantly increased white blood cell (WBC) count, indicating an infection. Further enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing was confirmed by active immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies specific to leptospira species, followed by a chest X-ray scan. The antibiotics doxycycline (for seven days) and ceftriaxone (two weeks) were used to treat the leptospirosis. The patient was also given antipyretics to bring down fever and antitussive agents to suppress the cough. Hydration and breathing exercises were also given high priority in healing from this illness. After treatment, the patient did very well, he sweated less before dawn, the rash started to go away, and finally, even coughing was controlled. Further blood tests have shown that now the WBC is in the normal range and the IgM antibody level has dropped. In other words, the infection has been eradicated. For detailed information, refer to the case study \"A Moral Call,\" which argues that early treatment and intervention are critical in managing leptospirosis. Getting this severe infection with early antibiotic therapy and nursing care gives people a chance for complete recovery from their illness. There must be more studies into this disease's long-term effects and how to prevent it when the risk group is more significant.",

        "abstract": "Hemoperfusion is a novel adjunct therapy that targets the dysregulated inflammatory events in severe sepsis. Previous studies have reported conflicting results on its efficacy and safety. This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of hemoperfusion among leptospirosis patients in septic shock and renal failure in terms of improvement in 28-day mortality, SOFA score, level of inflammatory markers, hemodynamics, and renal and pulmonary function. A total of 37 severe leptospirosis patients were enrolled and randomized into either standard medical therapy (SMT) alone, <i>n</i> = 20, or with hemoperfusion (HP), <i>n</i> = 17. Vital signs, urine output, vasopressor dose, PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> (P/F) ratio, and biochemical parameters of patients from each treatment arm were compared. The hemoperfusion group showed a 36.84% (<i>p</i> = 0.017) risk reduction in 28-day mortality. Levels of procalcitonin, IL6, and lactate significantly decreased from baseline to day 7 in both groups. Statistically significant improvements in serum creatinine (<i>p</i> = 0.04) and PF ratio (<i>p</i> = 0.045) were observed in the hemoperfusion cohort. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol approaches showed that hemoperfusion increased the survival rate and decreased the mortality risk. This benefit for survival persisted even when patients were also receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), showing that hemoperfusion's benefits are independent of ECMO use. Hemoperfusion is a safe and effective adjunct therapy for managing severe sepsis. It promotes earlier renal and pulmonary function recovery and improves the survival of septic shock patients.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a disease caused by the bacteria of the <i>Leptospira</i> genus, which can usually be acquired by humans through contact with urine from infected animals; it is also possible for this urine to contaminate soils and bodies of water. The disease can have deadly consequences in some extreme cases. Fortunately, until now, patients with leptospirosis have responded adequately to treatment with doxycycline and azithromycin, and no cases of antibiotic resistance have been reported. However, with the extensive use of such medications, more bacteria, such as <i>Staphylococci</i> and <i>Enterococci,</i> are becoming resistant. The purpose of this study is to determine the presence of genes related to antibiotic resistance in the <i>Leptospira</i> genus using bioinformatic tools, which have not been undertaken in the past. Whole genomes from the 69 described <i>Leptospira</i> species were downloaded from NCBI's GeneBank and analyzed using CARD (The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistant Database) and RAST (Rapid Annotations using Subsystem Technology). After a detailed genomic search, 12 genes associated with four mechanisms were found: resistance to beta-lactamases, vancomycin, aminoglycoside adenylyltransferases, as well as multiple drug efflux pumps. Some of these genes are highly polymorphic among different species, and some of them are present in multiple copies in the same species. In conclusion, this study provides evidence of the presence of genes related to antibiotic resistance in the genomes of some species of the genus <i>Leptospira</i>, and it is the starting point for future experimental evaluation to determine whether these genes are transcriptionally active in some species and serovars.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonosis and a life-threatening disease in humans and animals. Licensed killed whole-cell vaccines are available for animals; however, they do not offer heterologous protection, do not induce long-term protection, or prevent renal colonization. In this study, we characterized an immunogenic Leptospira methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) identified through a reverse vaccinology approach, predicted its structure, and tested the protective efficacy of a recombinant MCP fragment in the C3H/HeJ mice model. The predicted structure of the full-length MCP revealed an architecture typical for topology class I MCPs. A single dose of MCP vaccine elicited a significant IgG antibody response in immunized mice compared to controls (P < 0.0001), especially the IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses. The vaccination with MCP, despite eliciting a robust immune response, did not protect mice from disease and renal colonization. However, survival curves significantly differed between groups, and the MCP-vaccinated group developed clinical signs faster than the control group. There were differences in gross and histopathological changes between the MCP-vaccinated and control groups. The factors leading to enhanced disease process in vaccinated animals need further investigation. We speculate that anti-MCP antibodies may block the MCP signaling cascade and may limit chemotaxis, preventing Leptospira from reaching its destination, but facilitating its maintenance and replication in the blood stream. Such a phenomenon may exist in endemic areas where humans are highly exposed to Leptospira antigens, and the presence of antibodies might lead to disease enhancement. The role of this protein in Leptospira pathogenesis should be further evaluated to comprehend the lack of protection and potential exacerbation of the disease process. The absence of immune correlates of protection from Leptospira infection is still a major limitation of this field and efforts to gather this knowledge are needed.",

        "abstract": "Preeclampsia is a severe pregnancy disorder, affecting approximately 10% of pregnancies worldwide, characterised by hypertension and proteinuria after the 20th week of gestation. The condition poses significant risks to both maternal and fetal health, including cardiovascular complications and impaired fetal development. Recent trends indicate a rising incidence of preeclampsia, correlating with factors such as advanced maternal age and cardiovascular comorbidities. Emerging evidence also highlights a notable increase in the association between autoimmune and infectious diseases with preeclampsia. Autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus, and infections triggered by global health challenges, including leptospirosis, Zika, toxoplasmosis, and Chagas disease, are now recognised as significant contributors to preeclampsia susceptibility by affecting placental formation and function. This review focuses on the immunologic mechanisms underpinning preeclampsia, exploring how immune system dysregulation and infectious triggers exacerbate the condition. It also discusses the pathologic mechanisms, including galectins, that preeclampsia shares with autoimmune and infectious diseases, and their significant risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. We emphasise the necessity for accurate diagnosis and vigilant monitoring of immune and infectious diseases during pregnancy to optimise management and reduce risks. By raising awareness about these evolving risks and their impact on pregnancy, we aim to enhance diagnostic practices and preventive strategies, ultimately improving outcomes for pregnant women, especially in regions affected by environmental changes and endemic diseases.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis and melioidosis are common in tropical and temperate climates and can be acquired by exposure to contaminated water and soil. However, concomitant leptospirosis and melioidosis infection is rarely described in the literature. We report a case of leptospirosis-melioidosis coinfection and systematically review the literature. A 42-year-old male presented with fever associated with chills and rigor, dull aching pain in the right thigh, myalgia, progressive breathlessness, and dry cough for 10 days. At presentation, he was tachypneic and had tachycardia, and oxygen saturation was 46% in room air. Chest radiography and computed tomography scan showed interstitial involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging for thigh pain revealed right femur osteomyelitis. Leptospira serology was positive, and blood culture grew Burkholderia pseudomallei, confirming the diagnosis of melioidosis. Thus, a diagnosis of presumptive leptospirosis based on modified Faine's criteria and systemic melioidosis was made. He received doxycycline and intravenous meropenem and improved. We performed a systematic review to understand the spectrum of leptospirosis-melioidosis coinfection. We identified only nine cases of coinfection described in literature. Only one patient had septic arthritis, and our case is the only one presenting with osteomyelitis. Serology diagnosed leptospirosis, whereas melioidosis was confirmed by blood culture in most patients. The majority of coinfected patients developed some complications, and six died. Leptospirosis-melioidosis coinfection is rarely reported in the literature. Physicians should maintain a high index suspicion of leptospirosis-melioidosis coinfection in patients presenting with acute febrile illness following exposure to soil or freshwater, particularly in tropical and endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a re-emerging worldwide zoonotic disease. Infected patients and animals often exhibit intestinal symptoms. Mounting evidence suggests that host immune responses to bacterial infection are closely associated with intestinal homeostasis. Our previous research has shown that the gut microbiota can protect the host from acute leptospirosis, while the specific bacterial metabolic mediators participating in the pathogenesis remain to be identified. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are metabolites produced mainly by the gut microbiota that play a role in immune regulation. However, whether SCFAs are the key to protecting the host against leptospirosis and the underlying regulatory mechanisms are unknown. In this study, our results showed that the SCFA butyrate is involved in ameliorating leptospirosis. The depletion of SCFAs by antibiotic cocktail treatment reduced survival time after <i>Leptospira</i> infection while supplementation with butyrate but not acetate or propionate significantly amelioration of leptospirosis. <i>In vitro</i> experiments showed that butyrate treatment enhanced the intracellular bactericidal activity mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Mechanistically, butyrate functions as a histone deacetylase 3 inhibitor (HDAC3i) to promote ROS production <i>via</i> monocarboxylate transporter (MCT). The protection of butyrate against acute leptospirosis mediated by ROS was also proven <i>in vivo</i>. Collectively, our data provide evidence that the butyrate-MCT-HDAC3i-ROS signaling axis is a potential therapeutic target for acute leptospirosis. Our work not only interprets the microbial metabolite signaling involved in transkingdom interactions between the host and gut microbiota but also provides a possible target for developing a prevention strategy for acute leptospirosis. Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease caused by <i>Leptospira</i>. An estimated 1 million people are infected with leptospirosis each year. Studies have shown that healthy gut microbiota can protect the host against leptospirosis but the mechanism is not clear. This work elucidated the mechanism of gut microbiota protecting the host against acute leptospirosis. Here, we find that butyrate, a metabolite of gut microbiota, can improve the survival rate of hamsters with leptospirosis by promoting the bactericidal activity of macrophages. Mechanistically, butyrate upregulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels after macrophage infection with <i>Leptospira</i> by inhibiting HDAC3. This work confirms the therapeutic potential of butyrate in preventing acute leptospirosis and provides evidence for the benefits of the macrophage-HDAC3i-ROS axis.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis, an acute bacterial zoonotic disease, is endemic in Puerto Rico. Infection in approximately 10%-15% of patients with clinical disease progresses to severe, potentially fatal illness. Increased incidence has been associated with flooding in endemic areas around the world. In 2022, Hurricane Fiona, a Category 1 hurricane, made landfall and inundated Puerto Rico with heavy rainfall and severe flooding, increasing the risk for a leptospirosis outbreak. In response, the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) changed guidelines to make leptospirosis cases reportable within 24 hours, centralized the case investigation management system, and provided training and messaging to health care providers. To evaluate changes in risk for leptospirosis after Hurricane Fiona to that before the storm, the increase in cases was quantified, and patient characteristics and geographic distribution were compared. During the 15 weeks after Hurricane Fiona, 156 patients experienced signs and symptoms of leptospirosis and had a specimen with a positive laboratory result reported to PRDH. The mean weekly number of cases during this period was 10.4, which is 3.6 as high as the weekly number of cases during the previous 37 weeks (2.9). After Hurricane Fiona, the proportion of cases indicating exposure to potentially contaminated water increased from 11% to 35%, and the number of persons receiving testing increased; these factors likely led to the resulting overall surge in reported cases. Robust surveillance combined with outreach to health care providers after flooding events can improve leptospirosis case identification, inform clinicians considering early initiation of treatment, and guide public messaging to avoid wading, swimming, or any contact with potentially contaminated floodwaters.",

Five studies comprising 279 participants met the inclusion criteria. <b>Results:</b> Although some studies suggest potential benefits, particularly for pulmonary complications, the evidence remains inconclusive due to the limited number of studies and their methodological limitations. Notably, while four of the five reviewed studies indicated a possible positive role of corticosteroids, the single randomized controlled trial showed no significant benefit, highlighting the need for more robust research. <b>Conclusions:</b> While the current evidence provides a basis for potential benefits, it is not sufficient to make definitive clinical recommendations.

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a bacterium with a worldwide distribution and belongs to the group of zoonoses that can affect both humans and animals. Most cases of leptospirosis present as a mild, anicteric infection. However, a small percentage of cases develop Weil's disease, characterized by bleeding and elevated levels of bilirubin and liver enzymes. It can also cause inflammation of the gallbladder. Acute acalculous cholecystitis has been described as a manifestation of leptospirosis in a small percentage of cases; however, no association between leptospirosis and acute acalculous cholecystitis has been found in the literature. In this report, we describe the case of a 66-year-old patient who presented to the emergency department with a clinical picture dominated by fever, an altered general condition, abdominal pain in the right hypochondrium, nausea, and repeated vomiting. Acute calculous cholecystitis was diagnosed based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. During preoperative preparation, the patient exhibited signs of liver and renal failure with severe coagulation disorders. Obstructive jaundice was excluded after performing an abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography scan. The suspicion of leptospirosis was then raised, and appropriate treatment for the infection was initiated. The acute cholecystitis symptoms went into remission, and the patient had a favorable outcome. Surgery was postponed until the infection was treated entirely, and a re-evaluation of the patient's condition was conducted six-week later. The icterohemorrhagic form of leptospirosis, Weil's disease, can mimic acute cholecystitis, including the form with gallstones. Therefore, to ensure an accurate diagnosis, leptospirosis should be suspected if the patient has risk factors. However, the order of treatments is not strictly established and will depend on the clinical picture and the patient's prognosis.",

We present the clinical scenarios of two Bangladeshi males, aged 25 and 35 years, who were admitted to our hospital with acute febrile illness. The first patient exhibited hepatic and renal involvement, while the second presented with symptoms initially suggestive of meningoencephalitis. Both cases were initially managed under the presumption of dengue infection based on positive serology. However, further evaluation revealed coinfection with Leptospira, complicating the disease course. Both patients received appropriate treatment for dengue and antibacterial therapy for leptospirosis, ultimately resulting in their recovery. These case scenarios underscore the critical importance for clinicians in regions where dengue and Leptospira are endemic to consider both diseases when evaluating patients presenting with acute febrile illness.",

        "abstract": "Leptospirosis is a globally transmitted zoonotic disease caused by Leptospira spp., a highly mobile, obligate aerobic, spiral-shaped bacteria. Described first by Adolf Weil in 1886, leptospirosis in Germany is rare, leading to a delayed diagnosis due to diverse symptoms. Most cases are mild, but severe forms, like Weil's disease, cause life-threatening complications such as fever, jaundice, hemoptysis, and acute kidney injury (AKI). The aim of this work was to provide a literature review of leptospirosis with renal manifestation based on a case report. We report the case of an 81-year-old male patient with initially unclear oliguric AKI, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and jaundice. After excluding common AKI causes, the expanded patient history suggested possible rat contact in his chicken coop. Finally, we serologically identified an infection with Leptospira spp. by positive IgM, proving that the illness was compatible with classical Weil's disease. The patient underwent temporary hemodialysis and antibiotic treatment with intravenous penicillin G for 2 weeks. Under therapy, the AKI, hyperbilirubinemia, and clinical condition of the patient improved. The patient was discharged after 2 weeks. In the following controls, slightly impaired kidney function was observed, indicating a progress of his chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although leptospirosis is rare, there are some cases with a fulminant course. Impairment of renal function often correlates with severity of the disease requiring antibiotic treatment. In some cases, AKI progresses to CKD demonstrating the need to raise awareness for leptospirosis.",
