        "abstract": "Human toxoplasmosis remains a significant, yet often underrecognized, global health concern. This review highlights emerging advances in prevention and management, offering timely updates for clinicians and researchers. Recent venison-associated outbreaks in the United States have emphasized the risk of ocular toxoplasmosis and severe disease in immune competent individuals and the need for heightened clinical suspicion. Updated guidelines for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients now recommend systematic screening, qPCR monitoring, and prophylaxis to reduce mortality from Toxoplasma gondii reactivation. Emerging evidence suggests that chronic T. gondii infection may contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes, challenging the long-held assumption that chronic infection is protective against these complications. Although the potential association between chronic T. gondii infection and neuropsychiatric disorders remains debated, its public health relevance warrants further investigation. Improved clinical awareness, applied preventive strategies, and expanded research are essential to mitigate the broader health impact of chronic T. gondii infection. Future well designed studies and rigorous analyses are critical to defining maternal-fetal risks and potential neuropsychiatric effects, providing the evidence needed to update clinical guidelines and inform public health policies.",

        "abstract": "Donor human milk is recommended for the nutritionally vulnerable preterm infant; however, there is conflicting or limited information on how the pasteurization techniques used on donor milk influence its nutritional and immune properties. Additionally, prior pasteurization studies were often not reflective of the volume and equipment used in milk bank settings, limiting their generalizability. Evaluate the impact of Holder pasteurization-performed in a milk bank setting and using standardized preanalytical handling techniques-on the energy, macronutrients, human milk oligosaccharides, vitamins, minerals, and antimicrobial protein content of human milk. Fifty matched pairs of raw and Holder-pasteurized milk samples that were collected and pasteurized in a milk bank setting provided the sampling frame. Each pair was from a unique, approved milk bank donor to the Mothers' Milk Bank of North Texas. A total of 29 nutrients and bioactive factors were assessed using a variety of analytical methods. There was evidence of minimal losses (<15%) in copper, calcium, thiamine, and nonprotein nitrogen, moderate losses in immunoglobin A concentrations (35%), and extensive losses in lactoferrin (>80%). Holder pasteurization has minimal to no impact on energy and essential nutrients in donor milk, including macronutrients, human milk oligosaccharides, B vitamins, and minerals. Moderate to extensive loss of antimicrobial proteins warrants research into alternative preservation techniques.",

        "abstract": "Following expansive legalization of cannabis in many parts of the United States, cannabis use in pregnancy has increased several fold. There is a pressing need to understand the maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with this exposure. To quantify the maternal and neonatal outcomes of mothers using cannabis during pregnancy. We searched five databases for all relevant observational studies, from each database's inception until March 1st 2024. Two reviewers separately screened the studies in duplicate. Our initial search yielded 5184 studies, of which 51 (0.98%) were included in our qualitative synthesis. Our study adhered to PRISMA guidelines and independent extraction by two researchers was utilized. We used a 95% confidence interval and the random effects model, as there was significant heterogeneity between studies. The 51 included studies yielded a total population of 7,920,383 pregnant women. Cannabis consumption was associated with increased risks of low birth weight (RR = 1.69,95% CI = (1.34,2.14),P < 0.0001), small for gestational age (RR = 1.79,95% CI = (1.52, 2.1),P < 0.00001), major anomalies (RR = 1.81,95% CI = (1.48, 2.23),P < 0.00001), decreased head circumference (MD = -0.34,95% CI = (-0.57,-0.11),P = 0.004), birth weight (MD = -177.81,95% CI = (-224.72,-130.91),P < 0.00001), birth length (MD = -0.87,95% CI = (-1.15,-0.59),P < 0.00001), gestational age (MD = -0.21,95% CI = (-0.35,-0.08),P = 0.002), NICU admission (RR = 1.55,95% CI = (1.36,1.78),P < 0.00001), perinatal mortality (RR = 1.72,95% CI = (1.09,2.71),P = 0.02), and preterm delivery (RR = 1.39,95% CI = (1.23,1.56),P < 0.00001). Cannabis use was also associated with a decreased risk of gestational diabetes in pregnancy (RR = 0.64,95% CI = (0.55,0.75),P < 0.00001).

        "title": "Polysocial risk factors and trajectories of antenatal moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms: a retrospective cohort study in Shenzhen, China.",
        "abstract": "Antenatal depression, especially moderate-to-severe depression, is associated with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes and is affected by multiple psychosocial factors. However, the cumulative effects of psychosocial determinants and trajectories of antenatal depression are underappreciated. This study aimed to investigate the cumulative effects of various psychosocial determinants on antenatal moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms (MSD) based on the polysocial risk score (PsRS), to identify trajectories of MSD based on group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM), and to explore the association between the PsRS and diverse trajectories. A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 21,336 pregnant women in Shenzhen, China, from 2020 to 2023. Antenatal depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) across three pregnancy trimesters. The PsRS was selected and calculated by counting established social determinants from four social risk domains, including socioeconomic status, lifestyle behaviors, psychosocial factors, and living conditions. GBTM was employed to identify distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms. Multinomial logistic regression investigated the relationship between PsRS and diverse trajectories. Of women, 9.1% experienced at least one episode of MSD across three pregnancy trimesters. An intermediate PsRS and a high PsRS were associated with higher risks of MSD during pregnancy, with the adjusted hazard ratios being 1.99 (95% CI, 1.71-2.31) and 4.44 (95% CI, 3.81-5.17), respectively, compared with those with a low PsRS. GBTM identified five distinct trajectories of antenatal depressive symptoms: persistent MSD, resolving MSD, chronic mild, resolving mild, and no depressive symptoms. Above all trajectories, persistent MSD demonstrated the highest PSRS scores and risk gradients. This study provides a practical basis for integrating early polysocial risk screening into routine prenatal care, enabling the timely identification and targeted support of high-risk pregnant women. These findings underscore the need for incorporating comprehensive social risk assessment into maternal health policies and intervention programs to improve mental health outcomes across pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "Pregnancy presents a critical \"teachable moment\" for promoting healthy dietary behaviors, with significant implications for maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, achieving sustained dietary behavior change remains complex. This systematic review aimed to examine the effectiveness of dietary interventions during pregnancy and explore the underlying mechanisms of behavior change, focusing on behavior change techniques (BCTs) through the lens of the COM-B model. This review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and employed a narrative synthesis approach. A comprehensive search of six electronic databases and grey literature sources was performed. Studies were eligible if they evaluated dietary interventions targeting pregnant women and reported outcomes related to eating behavior or gestational weight gain. Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. Intervention components were coded using the Behavior Change Technique (BCT) Taxonomy V1. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for randomized controlled trials and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies. The review revealed mixed findings regarding the effectiveness of dietary interventions, largely due to substantial heterogeneity in intervention designs, delivery methods, and outcome measures. Commonly employed BCTs included goal setting, action planning, knowledge shaping, and feedback. Most interventions targeted psychological capability and reflective motivation, while fewer addressed social opportunity and environmental restructuring. Current dietary interventions predominantly focus on enhancing individual motivation and capabilities but often overlook social and environmental barriers. Future research should design interventions that incorporate broader COM-B dimensions, address health literacy disparities, and tailor strategies to participants' contextual needs. A deeper understanding of behavior change mechanisms may enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of dietary interventions during pregnancy. Registered on PROSPERO database (CRD42022310860).",

        "abstract": "Cambodia, a lower-middle-income country, confronts challenges related to childbirth safety. This study investigated the utilization of childbirth care across public and private health facilities, with a particular focus on the use of caesarean section (C-section). It also examined disparities in service utilization across urban and rural areas and among different socioeconomic statuses. This study used cross-sectional data from the Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in Cambodia in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2014 and 2021-22. Descriptive analyses were performed to elucidate changes in place of delivery and C-section rates by public and private health facilities. Logistic regressions were applied using data from 2010 to 2021 to identify factors associated with C-section. The facility-based delivery rate significantly increased to 96.5% by 2021, while the overall C-section rate rose to 15.5%. Within public facilities, the C-section rate grew from 5.1% in 2010 to 9.7% in 2021, consistently higher in urban areas compared to rural ones. Notably, C-section utilization in public facilities did not significantly vary among different wealth index groups. From 2010 to 2021, the C-section rates in private facilities surged from 11.0% to 48.1%, with urban and rural rates reaching 50.5% and 45.7%, respectively. In 2021, the richest and richer groups accounted for most C-section deliveries in private facilities, constituting 38.5% and 28.8%, respectively. C-section use was significantly higher in 2021 compared to 2010 (Adjusted OR 3.32, 95% CI [2.72, 4.07]). Women over 20 years old, living in Central Plain, from richer or richest households, had secondary and higher education level, with female household head and had only one child were more likely to undergo a C-section than other women. The private facilities have significantly driven the increase in C-sections, particularly among wealthier economic groups. Strengthening health system governance and promoting public-private partnerships are vital to curb C-section overuse and ensure equitable and effective childbirth care coverage.",

        "abstract": "Uterine leiomyosarcoma is a rare and heterogeneous gynecological malignancy that poses a significant clinical challenge due to its aggressive nature and limited treatment options. Its multifactorial etiopathogenesis involves complex cytogenetic and molecular aberrations, including TP53, RB1, and chromothripsis-associated gene alterations. The non-specific clinical presentation, resembling other benign conditions, complicates early and accurate diagnosis, alongside intricate radiological and pathological patterns. Advanced imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, are employed to differentiate uterine leiomyosarcoma from benign conditions, but no single test is definitive. For FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage I uterine leiomyosarcoma, treatment consists of en bloc total hysterectomy ± bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Patients with stage II to IV disease amenable to complete resection can undergo surgery followed by adjuvant systemic therapy and/or radiotherapy. Lymphadenectomy is unnecessary in patients lacking bulky nodes. Unresectable or unsuitable cases warrant primary systemic therapy and/or radiotherapy. Managing recurrent disease requires a multimodal approach tailored to factors such as the site and number of metastases, prior radiotherapy, and resectability. Multidisciplinary management and centralization in referral centers are crucial for individualized decision-making. Ongoing research explores the intricate cytogenetic and molecular aberrations of uterine leiomyosarcoma, paving the way for personalized treatment strategies. This review, developed following the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology/Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup/European Reference Network on Rare Adult Solid Cancers guidelines, explores the clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges, and evolving therapeutic strategies for uterine leiomyosarcoma, while also highlighting variations in clinical practice worldwide.",

        "abstract": "Current guidelines recommend that pregnant women engage in physical activity. Exercise during pregnancy has been shown to positively impact both maternal and fetal outcomes. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the impact of structured physical activity during pregnancy on maternal health and fetal outcomes. A systematic search was conducted on relevant articles published between 2015 and 2020 using PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. Studies on pregnant women, comparative study designs with concurrent controls, structured physical intervention and health outcomes for both maternal and fetal were targeted. Maternal outcomes include gestational weight gain, lumbopelvic pain, gestational diabetes and preeclampsia, while fetal outcomes include prematurity and birth weight. Only original studies with published data were included. This review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analysis. A total of 3441 published articles were retrieved from different databases. After assessing the obtained papers, studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded. Twenty studies involving 5188 populations that met the inclusion criteria were included in this review. However, due to the heterogeneity of the studies, metaanalysis was not done. Structured physical activity significantly reduced the risk of gestational diabetes (OR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.40-0.81; p = 0.002), but had no statistically significant effect on lumbopelvic pain (OR 0.98 (95% CI: 0.49 to 1.93) p=0.95), gestational weight gain (OR 0.88 95% CI: (0.44, 1.76) p=0.71), pre-eclampsia (OR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.41, 1.49, p=0.46) causing preterm delivery (OR 0.91, 95% CI (0.69, 1.20), p=0.50) or affecting fetal birth weight (mean difference 0.93, 95% CI (-42.67, 44.53), p=0.97) CONCLUSION: Structured physical activity during pregnancy, three times a week, 30 minutes per day of moderate intensity, is safe and benefits pregnant women and the fetus. Our findings challenge the view that physical exercise during pregnancy is not helpful and can be harmful. To generate further evidence, there is a need for high-quality, standardised trials that assess specific types of structured exercise program with better reporting of adherence and outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Stronger maternal-fetal attachment contributes to less prenatal maternal mental stress and better pregnancy outcomes, ultimately leading to healthier mother-infant relationships and infants with far fewer cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal issues. The literature suggests that a lack of maternal factors, such as oral health knowledge and prenatal dental care utilization, is directly linked to the incidence of early childhood caries (ECC). The authors hypothesize that innovative maternal behavioral change communication (MBCC) interventions targeting pregnant mothers could help improve the general/oral health literacy and outcomes of both themselves and their infants. The study is conducted as a randomized controlled trial (3-arm parallel design) reto assess the ability of an MBCC intervention to develop and strengthen the maternal-fetal/infant bond and encourage awareness and understanding of good oral health, behavior, and practices among expecting mothers and their newborn infants to prevent ECC. Pregnant women (n = 450) aged 20-35 years in the 12th -20th week of gestation will be the sampling frame for the study, which will be extended to a 2-year postnatal period. Women randomized to the study groups will be provided with timely intervention videos that contain information on prenatal bonding and preventive pre- and postnatal oral health care, whereas women in the control group will receive general information via pamphlets, e-flyers, and brochures on preventive oral care for a healthy pregnancy. Oral health screening and counselling will be provided during the follow-up visits of the mother and her infant. The outcome measures will include the incidence of ECC among infants (primary outcome), prenatal/postnatal maternal-fetal/infant attachment measures, maternal oral health knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP), caries risk assessment, and oral health measures (secondary outcomes). The study outcomes will be added to substantiate the use of MBCC interventions in reducing the incidence of ECC. A stronger maternal-Fetal/Infant bond may also possibly contribute to babies receiving greater maternal affection and developing a strong sense of trust. If positive, this model of care can be widely applied in clinical practice to ensure holistic health care and thereby achieve sustainable positive health outcomes.

        "abstract": "The ossification of the occipital bone begins in the basilar part and progresses anteriorly, which is vital for the normal development of both the cranial and facial skeleton. Abnormal ossification of the occipital bone is associated with congenital anomalies such as Chiari malformation and anencephaly. Despite this, morphometric data on the ossification centers of the occipital bone, particularly in the lateral and basilar parts, remain limited. The aim of this study was to provide a detailed morphometric analysis of the primary ossification centers in the lateral and basilar parts of the occipital bone in human fetuses using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 40 human fetuses (24 males and 16 females) aged 17 to 42 weeks of gestation were included in the study. These specimens were collected from spontaneous miscarriages and preterm deliveries, with all ethical standards followed. High-resolution MRI imaging was performed using a Siemens Magnetom Prisma 3T MRI scanner. 3D volumetric data of the ossification centers in the lateral and basilar parts of the occipital bone were acquired and analyzed using 3D Slicer software. Linear, planar, and volumetric parameters, including 3D maximum diameter, projection surface area, and volume, were measured for both parts of the occipital bone. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS Statistics 23 software, with regression analyses to model growth dynamics. The analysis revealed that the ossification centers of both the lateral and basilar parts of the occipital bone exhibited proportional growth relative to gestational age, with significant correlations between age and the measured parameters. The mean 3D maximum diameters, projection surface areas, and volumes showed consistent growth patterns, with no significant differences based on sex or laterality. The developmental dynamics were best described by linear regression models, with high coefficients of determination (R² > 0.75) for all parameters. This study provides normative morphometric data for the primary ossification centers of the lateral and basilar parts of the occipital bone in human fetuses, offering valuable insights into the normal growth patterns of these structures. The findings contribute to the understanding of cranial base development and provide a reference framework for the early detection of congenital cranial anomalies. The use of MRI in fetal imaging proves to be a reliable and non-invasive method for studying fetal skeletal development. Not applicable.",

There is a consensus among the reviewed guidelines regarding the appropriate algorithm for diagnosis of VTE in the obstetric population, the appropriate anticoagulants suitable for the pregnancy and puerperium, even in cases of contraindications for heparin, and indications for extreme management measures, such as thrombolysis. On the other hand, few discrepancies were detected on the dosage of anticoagulants, indications of anticoagulation monitoring, appropriate management of anticoagulants related to neuraxial anesthesia, and indications for thrombophilia testing following a VTE event. Notably, only the European Society of Cardiology recommends the use of models assessing the clinical likelihood of pulmonary embolism, suggests a risk stratification algorithm to guide acute management, and proposes management strategies for the prevention of hemorrhagic events during labor. VTE is a significant contributor of maternal morbidity and mortality, especially if managed in a suboptimal way. Hence, the development of consistent evidence-based protocols and algorithms is crucial to safely guide pregnant women and their physicians toward reducing improving fetal and maternal outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is a lethal gynecologic malignancy with limited therapeutic success due to late diagnosis and therapy resistance. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) are key to tumor adaptation, yet the mechanisms sustaining ER homeostasis in OC remain poorly defined. We combined multi-omics analyses, tissue microarrays, and in vitro and in vivo models. Functional assays involved COPB2 knockdown or overexpression in OC cells, xenografts in nude mice, and mechanistic studies including protein interaction and glycoproteomic analyses. COPB2 was significantly upregulated in OC and associated with poor prognosis. It promoted cell proliferation and survival by alleviating ER stress and suppressing apoptosis. Mechanistically, COPB2 interacted with EDEM3, a key ERAD enzyme, enhancing its ER localization and mannose-trimming function. COPB2 depletion impaired EDEM3 activity, resulting in glycan processing defects and ER stress accumulation. In vivo, COPB2 overexpression accelerated tumor growth. This study identifies a novel COPB2-EDEM3 axis that maintains ER homeostasis and drives OC progression. Targeting this axis may offer new opportunities for therapeutic intervention and biomarker development.",

        "abstract": "In Africa, the burden of low birth weight (LBW) neonatal mortality remains substantial, yet comprehensive evidence is lacking, with varied and inconclusive findings from primary studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the pooled incidence and predictors of LBW neonatal mortality in Africa. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, African Journals Online, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Google for relevant studies. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to assess study quality. Heterogeneity and publication bias were evaluated using the <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> statistic and Egger's test. A random-effects model was applied due to significant heterogeneity, with pooled incidence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses explored sources of heterogeneity. This meta-analysis included 28 studies involving 56,775 LBW neonates. The pooled incidence of LBW neonatal mortality in Africa was 33.1% per 100 person-years (95% CI: 19.54-46.65), with substantial heterogeneity (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 99.9%, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Predictors associated with LBW neonatal mortality included extremely low birth weight (PHR = 4.37, 95% CI: 2.62-7.29), lack of antenatal care follow-up (PHR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.21-6.67), perinatal asphyxia (PHR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.38-2.16), necrotizing enterocolitis (PHR = 2.80, 95% CI: 2.03-3.86), preterm birth (PHR = 3.17, 95% CI: 1.88-5.35), respiratory distress syndrome (PHR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.57-2.23), sepsis (PHR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.59-2.63), lack of kangaroo mother care (PHR = 5.29, 95% CI: 2.76-10.16), maternal diabetes mellitus (PHR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.87-4.01), and maternal HIV infection (PHR = 4.47, 95% CI: 2.06-9.67). This study highlights a concerning high incidence of LBW neonatal mortality in Africa. Strategies targeting these predictors, such as improving antenatal care, promoting kangaroo mother care, and managing maternal health conditions like diabetes and HIV, could substantially reduce LBW neonatal mortality in the region. Policymakers and healthcare providers should prioritize these interventions to mitigate the high burden of LBW neonatal mortality and improve neonatal health outcomes across Africa. identifier, CRD42024560375.",

        "abstract": "Hyperglycemia in pregnancy (HIP) poses significant risks to maternal and fetal health yet remains underreported, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. This public health challenge includes gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), pre-existing diabetes, and diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy, with regional prevalence rates as high as 28%. Left untreated, HIP can lead to adverse maternal outcomes such as preeclampsia and excessive gestational weight gain, as well as neonatal complications, including macrosomia and neonatal hypoglycemia.International and regional guidelines emphasize early detection and tailored interventions when addressing unmet medical needs in HIP management. Screening protocols vary, with a one-step oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) increasingly favoured for its diagnostic accuracy. Metformin, recognized for its favorable safety profile, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness, has emerged as a preferred first-line treatment alongside lifestyle modifications. Recent updates to metformin's regulatory labelling highlight its safe use during pregnancy, with evidence demonstrating benefits such as reduced maternal weight gain and neonatal complications.This expert recommendation from the Asia-Pacific region focus on the use of metformin during pregnancy and the periconceptional period. Recommendations advocate for routine screening, optimal glycemic control, and structured postpartum care to mitigate HIP's long-term health impacts. Integrating metformin into management strategies enhances patient satisfaction, accessibility, and overall outcomes, offering a practical solution to improve maternal and neonatal health in diverse healthcare settings.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated adherence to Indonesia's Dietary Guidelines (IDG) among lactating women, examining related factors and association with nutrient intake adequacy, maternal and infant biomarkers, body mass index, and growth. Participants were lactating women (n = 220) from urban and rural West Java, Indonesia. Dietary intake (via 3-day weighed food records), anthropometry and blood samples were assessed. Adherence was evaluated using a scoring system tailored for IDG and adapted from the Healthy Eating Index to assess intake of food groups, sugar, salt, fat, water, coffee, and breakfast habits. Starchy staples intake exceeded recommendations by nearly double (median 7.1 vs. recommended 3-4 servings/day), while vegetable (0.5 servings/day), fruit (1.0), and water (1300 mL/day) intake fell notably short. Protein-rich food intake (3.5 servings/day) was closer to target. Only 1% of participants met three out of four food group targets. Adherence to the meal-based MyPlate framework showed similar imbalances, with 68% of the plate occupied by starchy staples versus the recommended 33%. Sociodemographic factors, including education, wealth, and family size, were associated with adherence to IDG components. For instance, women in the highest wealth quintile had higher adherence scores for starchy staple moderation (mean 4.3) than those in the lowest (mean 2.9). Adherence to IDG components correlated positively with nutrient intake adequacy (e.g. protein-rich food and overall adequacy: r = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.06-0.32) but not consistently with maternal or infant biomarkers. These findings highlight the need to refine dietary guidelines with clearer portion guidance and consideration of factors beyond intake adequacy during lactation.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects 7-9% of pregnancies worldwide and is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Nutritional therapy is a key component of GDM management. However, inconsistencies exist across international and national guidelines regarding macronutrient distribution, glycemic targets, and micronutrient supplementation. This systematic review aims to compare updated nutritional recommendations for GDM across major health organizations and identify areas of consensus, divergence, and evidence gaps. <b>Methods:</b> This systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251026194). A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar (concluding March 2025), along with manual searches of official websites of professional health organizations (e.g., ADA, WHO, NICE, IDF). Guidelines published within the last 10 years (or the most relevant national guideline if slightly older), available in English or with access to translation, and including explicit nutritional recommendations for GDM were included. Data were extracted on macronutrient composition, glycemic targets, and micronutrient supplementation, with evaluation of the supporting evidence and regional context, incorporating findings from recent key guideline updates. <b>Results:</b> In total, 12 guidelines met the inclusion criteria. While all guidelines emphasized carbohydrate moderation and adequate fiber intake, significant discrepancies were found in carbohydrate quality recommendations (e.g., low-glycemic index focus vs. total carbohydrate restriction), postprandial glucose targets (e.g., 1-h vs. 2-h measurements and varying thresholds like <120 vs. <140 mg/dL), and the use of non-routine micronutrients such as chromium, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids (generally lacking endorsement). Recent updates from key bodies like ADA, Diabetes Canada, and KDA largely maintain these core stances but show increasing emphasis on dietary patterns and acknowledgement of CGM technology, without resolving key discrepancies. Cultural adaptability and behavioral counselling strategies were minimally addressed across most guidelines. <b>Conclusions:</b> Despite general agreement on the principal recommendations of nutritional management in GDM, substantial variation persists in specific recommendations, even considering recent updates. Consistent, evidence-based, and culturally adaptable guidelines incorporating implementation strategies are needed to optimize care and reduce disparities in GDM management across regions.",

In Italy, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to prevent GBS-EOD is offered to pregnant women who tested as GBS-positive in late pregnancy. Passive surveillance in Italy showed that a non-negligible number of GBS-EOD cases (about 50%) occurred from GBS-negative pregnant women.

        "title": "Calcium Supplementation in Pregnancy: A Systematic Review of Clinical Studies.",
        "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Calcium is an essential mineral that plays a vital role in fetal development and maternal health during pregnancy. The World Health Organization recommends a daily calcium intake of 1.5-2 g for pregnant adult women. Calcium deficiency during gestation may lead to complications, such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, loss of bone mineral density, impaired fetal development, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. The aim of the present review is to evaluate the current clinical evidence on calcium intake during pregnancy. <i>Methods</i>: The present systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 statement by searching two major databases, PubMed and Mendeley. The study protocol was registered in the Open Science Framework (DOI: osf.io/rvj7z). Inclusion criteria were clinical trials on calcium supplementation during pregnancy. Exclusion criteria were clinical guidelines, reviews, case reports, case series, letters, and commentaries. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. <i>Results</i>: Initially, 451 publications were identified, and after removal of duplicates and screening of titles and/or abstracts and/or full texts, 34 studies were included. The number of participants ranged between 30 and 22,000 women. Calcium supplementation was associated with lower incidence of and less severe gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, lower risk of preterm birth, longer pregnancy duration and higher neonatal birth weight, and improved maternal bone mineral density postpartum. When the doses were split up into smaller doses, the benefits were strongest with high-dose regimens (1.5-2 g/day). <i>Conclusions</i>: Calcium supplementation during pregnancy has beneficial effects on maternal and neonatal health, especially in populations with insufficient dietary daily calcium intake and women at high risk of hypertensive disorders. Daily dose may vary according to individual needs, daily dietary calcium intake, and general health status. Further large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are necessary to confirm these findings.",

        "abstract": "Assisted reproduction technology (ART) has advanced significantly over the past four decades, leading to improved pregnancy outcomes and a reduction in complications, particularly those associated with multiple pregnancies. These improvements largely stem from advances in understanding embryonic physiology, which has enabled better culture conditions. As a result, embryologists can now efficiently culture embryos to the blastocyst stage and successfully cryopreserve them for future use. However, while incubators aim to replicate the maternal environment of the oviduct and uterus, embryos in vitro are cultured in static conditions, unlike the dynamic, constantly changing environment they experience in vivo. Key factors such as pH, temperature, osmolality, and gas concentrations are crucial for establishing optimal embryo development and implantation potential. Moreover, the vitrification procedure for gametes or embryos can introduce oxidative stress, as well as osmotic shock and cryoprotectant toxicity, which may affect embryo viability and increase the risk of birth defects. Since the first successful ART birth in 1978, over 10 million babies have been conceived through these techniques. Although most of these children are healthy, concerns exist about potential birth defects or changes linked to the handling of gametes and embryos. The preimplantation period is marked by significant epigenetic reprogramming, which can be influenced by ART procedures such as ovarian stimulation, in vitro fertilization, embryo culture, and cryopreservation. However, the long-term health implications for offspring remain uncertain. Epigenetic reprogramming during early embryogenesis is essential for proper embryo development and can be changed by ART-related conditions. These concerns have raised questions about the possible connection between ART and a higher risk of birth defects or other changes in children born through these methods. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines to map evidence on ART-related risks, including epigenetic and birth defect outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Evidence supports that engaging consumers in developing and co-designing research priorities and protocols with key stakeholders improves acceptability of and participation in research and leads to better health outcomes. This is particularly relevant when considering research with First Nations, migrant and refugee populations, adolescents, women living with disability and those in the LGBTQIA + community who face systemic disadvantage, shouldering a disproportionate burden of poor outcomes. This study aimed to identify priorities for maternal health research in the Top End of the NT from the perspective of consumers and key stakeholders. Using a participatory approach, focus groups and in-depth discussions with consumers, maternal health care providers and stakeholders were conducted over a three-month period (Part A), followed by a 1-day stakeholder forum in Darwin (Part B). Data was triangulated and a list of research priorities developed. Five priorities emerged. First, there is a need to develop and test strategies removing barriers for engagement of consumers and clinicians in maternal health research. Second, research into specific clinical concerns raised by consumers, such as prevention of preterm birth, must be complemented by health systems research enabling better patient journeys. Third, there is a need to develop and test innovative tools to enable comprehensive counselling of women from diverse backgrounds regarding aspects of care, based on most recent evidence-based and consumer needs. Further, there is a demand for research into innovative approaches to recruitment and retention of maternity care providers in a sparsely populated region of Australia, with a focus on provider well-being and continuity of integrated care. Finally, a need for research collaboration across similar settings and relevant disciplines to enable enhanced maternal health was identified. Emerging research priorities, implementing evidence-based practices, and regularly updating these priorities through ongoing stakeholder engagement, can work towards a future where maternal health services are accessible and responsive to the diverse needs of women and families residing in the Top End of the NT. Whilst consumers and stakeholders raised specific clinical priorities, health system research was identified as a key priority, focussing on patient journeys, co-design, and continuity of care through staff retention.",

        "abstract": "Ankyloglossia, commonly referred to as tongue tie, has become a topic of increasing interest for health care professionals and families. Global data reports a significant increase in surgical intervention to treat ankyloglossia. It is essential that professionals can identify ankyloglossia in infants accurately and reliably as a basis for providing evidence-based recommendations and intervention, and to understand better its potential impact and outcomes for infants and children. The systematic review aimed to (i) identify assessments of tongue structure and function used to diagnose ankyloglossia in infants from birth to 12 months; (ii) evaluate the psychometric properties of these tools, and (iii) identify a comprehensive assessment tool based on the review's findings. The Preferred Reporting Systems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were used to guide this systematic review. Searches for peer-reviewed articles were conducted on five electronic databases: Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ProQuest, Web of Science (WOS), Medline and Maternal and Infant Care (OVID). A total of 117 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in a narrative synthesis of extracted data. Nine assessment tools were identified with varying parameters of appearance and function included, as well as inconsistency in reporting of reliability and validity. Few studies used a measure of feeding as a diagnostic feature when identifying ankyloglossia in study participants. Based on the findings from this review, the Lingual Frenulum Protocol for Infants (LFPI) had the most reported reliability and validity for the assessment of tongue structure and function and is the most comprehensive tool for ankyloglossia diagnosis. Other tools are useful screeners in clinical practice, but do not provide an in-depth assessment of feeding function. The literature overall supports the notion that a comprehensive assessment of both structure and function, including feeding impact, is required to diagnose ankyloglossia. Based on this evaluation, recommendations for surgical and/or non-surgical intervention pathways can then be considered.",

        "abstract": "Large infants (birthweight > 75th centile) are at increased risk of mortality, severe neonatal neurological and non-neurological morbidity. We aimed to ascertain the optimal method and gestation of planned birth (scheduled caesarean section or induction of labor) that were associated with lower odds of adverse outcomes. This was a retrospective cohort study of term singleton births with birthweight >75th centile between January 2000 and December 2021 in Queensland, Australia. Primary outcomes were severe adverse maternal outcome, perinatal mortality (intrapartum stillbirth or neonatal death), severe neonatal neurological morbidity, and other severe neonatal morbidity. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to determine odds ratios (OR) for the effect of timing of both methods of planned birth on adverse outcomes. Induction of labor at 38<sup>+0</sup>-38<sup>+6</sup> weeks was the referent category because many international guidelines recommend this as the optimum timing of birth. There were 151,464 planned births for large infants. 86,515 (57.1%) were induction of labor while 64,949 (42.9%) were scheduled caesarean section. Compared to induction of labor at 38<sup>+0</sup>-38<sup>+6</sup> weeks, induction at ≥41<sup>+0</sup> weeks (aOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.21, 1.35) and scheduled caesarean section at 37<sup>+0</sup>-37<sup>+6</sup> weeks (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08, 1.28) were associated with greater odds of severe adverse maternal outcome, whilst scheduled caesarean section at 39<sup>+0</sup>-39<sup>+6</sup> weeks (aOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.70, 0.80) was associated with lower odds of this outcome. The odds of severe neonatal neurological morbidity were lower following induction at 40<sup>+0</sup>-40<sup>+6</sup> weeks (aOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59, 0.89) or scheduled caesarean section at 37<sup>+0</sup>-37<sup>+6</sup> weeks (aOR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43, 0.81), 39<sup>+0</sup>-39<sup>+6</sup> weeks (aOR 0.26, 95% CI 0.2, 0.33), and ≥41<sup>+0</sup> weeks (aOR 0.31, 95% CI 0.13, 0.75) respectively. For other severe neonatal morbidity, the odds were highest after induction of labor at 37<sup>+0</sup>-37<sup>+6</sup> weeks (aOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.24, 1.46), and lowest following scheduled caesarean section at 40<sup>+0</sup>-40<sup>+6</sup> weeks (aOR 0.31, 95% CI 0.26, 0.36). There were no significant differences in perinatal mortality based on method of planned birth or gestational age. In our cohort, scheduled caesarean section between 39<sup>+0</sup>-39<sup>+6</sup> weeks for large infants at birth was associated with lower odds of severe adverse maternal outcomes, severe neonatal neurological morbidity, and other severe neonatal morbidity compared to induction of labor at 38<sup>+0</sup>-38<sup>+6</sup> weeks. For women that underwent induction of labor, the odds of emergency caesarean section were lowest at 39<sup>+0</sup>-39<sup>+6</sup> weeks. Infants with birthweight >97th centile for gestational age had the highest risk of adverse outcomes regardless of gestation or method of planned birth.

        "abstract": "Evidence-based practice in intrapartum care is critical for lowering maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. Evidence-based practice, according to the World Health Organization Quality of Care Framework for Maternal and Newborn Health, is an important component of intrapartum care. However, little is understood about evidence-based intrapartum care practice in Ethiopia, particularly in the study setting. To assess evidence-based intrapartum care practice and associated factors among obstetric care professionals in Jimma Zone public hospitals in Southwest Ethiopia. A facility-based cross-sectional study was carried out on 217 obstetric care providers in Jimma Zone public hospitals in southwest Ethiopia. The study used a census approach to include all eligible participants within the specified population. Data were collected from June 1 to 30, 2023, using semistructured self-administered questionnaires. The collected data were entered into EpiData version 4.6 and exported to Statistical Packages for Social Sciences version 25 for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was run to see the association between evidence-based intrapartum care practice and predictor variables. Statistical significance was set at <i>p</i>-values less than 0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression. Overall, 41.2% (95% CI: 40.8-42.3) of obstetric care providers in Jimma Zone public hospitals used evidence-based practices for intrapartum care. Attending in-service training (AOR (95% CI): 3.5 (1.61-9.71)), accessibility of obstetric care guidelines (AOR (95% CI): 2.082 (1.222-3.547)), having regular case presentation (AOR (95% CI): 2.5 (1.234-6.743)), having knowledge (AOR (95% CI): 2.3 (1.222-3.547)), attitude of obstetric care providers (AOR (95% CI): 1.847 (1.065-3.204)), having less than 2 years of work experience (AOR (95% CI): 1.32 (1.012-3.56)), and having 2-5 years of work experience (AOR (95% CI): 3.49 (1.23-6.312)) were among factors significantly associated with evidence-based intra-partum care practice of obstetric care providers in Jimma Zone public hospitals. This study indicated that the majority of obstetric care providers did not practice evidence-based intrapartum care, which requires attention from all stakeholders. It is recommended for hospitals in the Jimma Zone to make guidelines available, provide in-service trainings, and identify systematic strategies to improve the knowledge and attitude of obstetric care providers.",

        "abstract": "People have contraceptive autonomy when they can obtain their preferred contraceptive method. Non-preferred method use may result from inappropriate medical contraindications, which occur when providers apply incorrect contraceptive eligibility criteria during consultations. Non-preferred method use and inappropriate medical contraindications are understudied in the Global South, partially due to measurement challenges. This study provides the first evidence in over two decades that inappropriate medical contraindications are still a barrier to preferred method use in the Global South and offer a new conceptual frame for a neglected medical barrier to contraceptive use. We collected qualitative data from 49 in-depth interviews and 17 focus group discussions (n = 146) with women of reproductive age (15-49) in an anonymized African country. We deductively identified instances of preferred method denial for medical reasons, then analyzed these episodes to determine whether the medical reasons for denial were evidence-based. We found that many women who reported preferred method denial described being offered medical reasons discordant with evidence-based guidelines, often resulting in what we determined to be contraceptive coercion. Specifically, we identified that (1) women experienced bi-directional contraceptive coercion with medical rationales, (2) women trusted providers' medical authority and felt unable to ask for more information, and finally, (3) women's personal reasons for their contraceptive preferences were rendered illegitimate by providers' use of biomedical language and (often incorrect) medical rationales. Consequentially, some women self-reported information indicating a legitimate contraindication to the non-preferred method their provider encouraged them to use. Inappropriate medical contraindications are an under-studied facility-level barrier to contraceptive access that can result in contraceptive coercion, negative health outcomes, discontinuation of wanted methods, and loss of reproductive autonomy. Addressing inappropriate medical contraindications will require solutions that negotiate both structural factors and individual provider behavior to improve the quality of contraceptive service provision.",

        "title": "Impact of Perioperative Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Caesarean Section on the Maternal Gut Microbiome: A Systematic Review.",
        "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Caesarean section (CS) accounts for over 20% of global births and routinely involves perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) to reduce surgical site infections. While the impact of such prophylaxis on neonatal microbiome development is well described, effects on the maternal gut microbiome remain underexplored. This systematic review synthesizes current evidence on how antibiotic prophylaxis during CS affects maternal gut microbiome composition and diversity-an underrepresented, but clinically relevant aspect of maternal-fetal medicine. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline (PubMed), the Cochrane Library, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) through November 2024. Inclusion criteria were defined according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Eligible studies used molecular techniques to report maternal gut microbiome outcomes (alpha- and beta-diversity). The search concentrated on beta-lactam antibiotics. Reference lists were screened, but no additional grey literature was searched. Synthesis followed the Synthesis Without meta-analysis (SWiM) approach. No review protocol was registered. The review received no external funding. <b>Results:</b> Out of 1011 records, three studies (total 286 mothers) met the inclusion criteria. All reported maternal microbiome outcomes secondarily to infant-focused research. Only one study provided pre- and post-birth stool samples. Applied antibiotic regimens, sequencing methods, and reported microbiome metrics for alpha- and beta-diversity varied considerably, thus limiting comparability of results. Due to high heterogeneity, no formal risk of bias was assessed. While taxonomic diversity changes were inconsistent, significant shifts in functional diversity metrics were observed postpartum. <b>Conclusions:</b> Evidence on maternal microbiome disruption following perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in CS is methodologically fragmented and limited by small sample sizes and inconsistent antibiotic protocols. Nonetheless, functional diversity appears sensitive to antibiotic exposure. To improve clinical understanding and safety, maternal-focused studies using standardized protocols are urgently needed. The maternal microbiome may play a key role in both recovery and shaping the newborn's early microbial environment.",

While post-transplant pregnancies are possible, they can lead to complications including pre-eclampsia, graft dysfunction, and other adverse outcomes. This study evaluates existing literature to assess pregnancy's impact on kidney transplantation outcomes, specifically long-term graft function and survival. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a systematic review of English-language literature from January 2000 to September 2023 across multiple databases, following PRISMA guidelines. We established inclusion criteria focusing on graft function and adverse events. Two independent reviewers performed data extraction, and we assessed risk of bias using the ROBINS-I tool. <b>Results:</b> From 4917 articles, we included 26 studies encompassing 1202 pregnancies in 902 kidney transplant recipients. Mean maternal age was 30.8 years, with an average interval of 52 months between transplant and pregnancy. Pre-pregnancy hypertension occurred in 54.2% of cases, and pre-eclampsia developed in 25.7%. The live birth rate reached 70.5%, while miscarriage, stillbirth, and neonatal death rates were 11.3%, 2.7%, and 2.5%, respectively. We noticed graft dysfunction during pregnancy in 20.2% of cases. Though kidney function often deteriorated temporarily, most patients recovered post-delivery. <b>Discussion:</b> Post-transplant pregnancies remain viable but high-risk, with elevated rates of obstetric complications. Our findings highlight the need for standardized data collection and reporting to better understand and manage pregnancy's impact on graft outcomes. <b>Conclusions:</b> With appropriate management, pregnancy in kidney transplant recipients is feasible, though it carries elevated risks of obstetric complications.

This study aimed to evaluate trends in pediatric emergency department (PED) visits for three key psychiatric conditions-anxiety disorders (ADs), self-injury behaviors (SIBs), and psychomotor agitation (PMA)-before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods</b>: We conducted a retrospective observational study at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Italy, analyzing all psychiatric presentations to the PED from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2024. The data were divided into pre-COVID and post-COVID periods and included patient demographics, recurrence of visits, clinical features, hospital admissions, and pharmacological management. Diagnoses were confirmed by chart review. <b>Results</b>: Of 233,867 total PED visits, 1082 were due to primary psychiatric concerns. A marked increase in visits was observed postCOVID: SIB incidence rose from 3.6 to 15.1 per 10,000 visits (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), PMA from 9.4 to 17.8 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), and AD from 17.7 to 21.6 (<i>p</i> = 0.018).

Pharmacological treatment remained largely consistent, with benzodiazepines and neuroleptics most frequently used. The emerging use of intranasal ketamine was noted in select cases. <b>Conclusions</b>: This study highlights the increasing burden of pediatric psychiatric emergencies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings underscore the urgent need to implement standardized emergency care protocols, strengthen outpatient mental health services, and develop pediatric-specific pharmacological guidelines to improve outcomes in this vulnerable population.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background and Objective:</b> Large language model (LLM)-based chatbots are increasingly utilized by postpartum individuals seeking guidance on breastfeeding. However, the chatbots' content quality, readability, and alignment with clinical guidelines remain uncertain. This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the quality, readability, and factual accuracy of responses generated by three publicly accessible AI chatbots-ChatGPT-4o Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Copilot Pro-when prompted with common maternal questions related to breast-milk supply. <b>Methods:</b> Twenty frequently asked breastfeeding-related questions were submitted to each chatbot in separate sessions. The responses were paraphrased to enable standardized scoring and were then evaluated using three validated tools: ensuring quality information for patients (EQIP), the simple measure of gobbledygook (SMOG), and the global quality scale (GQS). Factual accuracy was benchmarked against WHO, ACOG, CDC, and NICE guidelines using a three-point rubric. Additional user experience metrics included response time, character count, content density, and structural formatting. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with Bonferroni correction. <b>Results:</b> ChatGPT-4o Pro achieved the highest overall performance across all primary outcomes: EQIP score (85.7 ± 2.4%), SMOG score (9.78 ± 0.22), and GQS rating (4.55 ± 0.50), followed by Gemini 2.5 Pro and Copilot Pro (<i>p</i> < 0.001 for all comparisons). ChatGPT-4o Pro also demonstrated the highest factual alignment with clinical guidelines (95%), while Copilot showed more frequent omissions or simplifications. Differences in response time and formatting quality were statistically significant, although not always clinically meaningful. <b>Conclusions:</b> ChatGPT-4o Pro outperforms other chatbots in delivering structured, readable, and guideline-concordant breastfeeding information. However, substantial variability persists across the platforms, and none should be considered a substitute for professional guidance. Importantly, the phenomenon of AI hallucinations-where chatbots may generate factually incorrect or fabricated information-remains a critical risk that must be addressed to ensure safe integration into maternal health communication. Future efforts should focus on improving the transparency, accuracy, and multilingual reliability of AI chatbots to ensure their safe integration into maternal health communications.",

This concurrent validation study developed a School Readiness Index (SRI) with five readiness domains: early learning skills, approach to learning, cognitive skills, socioemotional development, and physical health. Through a cross-sectional comparative design, the school readiness skills of 119 Puerto Rican children (63 males, 56 females) aged 54-65 months were assessed using standardized tests (e.g., Batería IV Woodcock-Muñoz and NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery), parental questionnaires (e.g., Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3), and physical health assessments. Each measure was scored and classified using a binary coding system (0 and 1) based on participant abilities (e.g., 1 for expected performance, 0 if below expectations). A composite SRI score was calculated using 25 indicators. Discriminant validity was assessed by comparing children's registration status in the special education program (SEP). Sex, household income, and maternal education are key determinants of school readiness. Children registered in the SEP had significantly lower composite scores than those not registered, supporting the SRI's discriminant validity. The SRI is a reliable tool for identifying Hispanic children from Puerto Rico who may benefit from additional support. Inclusive and multidisciplinary assessment strategies are essential.",

Primary prophylaxis was performed with endoscopy plus non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) in 50%, endoscopy alone in 38%, and NSBBs alone in 12%. All centers managed acute variceal bleeding with endoscopy within 24 h, acid suppression, and octreotide infusion. Secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding was conducted using endoscopy (100%) and NSBBs (87%). Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was considered a good option when endoscopic treatment failed in 94% of centers. <i>Conclusions</i>: In Italy, there is broad consensus among centers regarding the management of gastrointestinal varices in children with portal hypertension.

        "abstract": "A lack of tests to assess fetal development impacts decision making around antenatal steroid use in women at risk of preterm birth. We analyzed the expression of 21 cfRNA targets related to human fetal lung maturation. Discovery studies were performed using maternal and fetal sheep plasma, with results compared to fetal lung mRNA expression. These findings were then validated in first, second, and third trimester human maternal plasma samples. Discovery studies utilized a preterm sheep model of pregnancy. Date mated ewes received saline (control n = 6), or antenatal steroids (dexamethasone n = 12) (betamethasone n = 11) prior to delivery and ventilation. We analyzed the expression of 21 human cfRNA targets related to lung maturation in maternal and fetal sheep plasma and compared this to mRNA expression in fetal lung tissue. Findings were first validated in a separate cohort of sheep exposed to betamethasone (n = 8), intraamniotic LPS endotoxin for lung maturation (n = 6), or untreated term animals (n = 6). Findings were further validated in maternal plasma from a human cohort of uncomplicated term pregnancies (n = 10). Delivery and ventilation data were analyzed with ANOVA, Tukey HSD, and Dunnett T3 tests. A Random Forest algorithm identified genes that separated mature from immature fetal lung subgroups and determined AUC values for maternal and fetal cell-free RNA (cfRNA) feature sets to predict fetal lung maturation. We demonstrate that the analysis of 21 human cfRNA targets in maternal plasma is highly predictive of fetal lung maturation status across antenatal steroid induced (Dexamethasone AUC = 0.93; Betamethasone AUC = 1) and physiological (AUC = 1) lung development models. Maternal plasma cfRNA expression in the dexamethasone antenatal steroid group closely resembled direct fetal lung tissue mRNA expression. These findings were then validated in human maternal plasma samples (1st vs. 3rd trimester AUC = 0.96; 2nd vs. 3rd trimester AUC = 1). Further development of this technology may provide a rapid, minimally invasive, and cost-effective clinical tool to optimize patient selection for initial and repeat courses of antenatal steroids, along with insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying fetal lung development.",

        "abstract": "Maternal mortality remains a critical public health concern in the U.S., with rising rates in recent years. Obstetric hemorrhage and hypertension in pregnancy are leading causes of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity. Maternal safety bundles, developed by the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, provide guidelines to improve maternal health outcomes. This study examined the implementation of obstetric hemorrhage and severe hypertension safety bundles in Arkansas hospitals, identifying factors associated with successful adoption. Safety bundle implementation data were collected from 37 hospitals in the third quarter of 2023. Hospital characteristics were obtained from the American Hospital Association database. Implementation index scores were calculated as the percentage of recommended elements adopted, both overall and within specific domains. Descriptive statistics summarized hospital characteristics and implementation status. Implementation differences across domains were assessed using Friedman's test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, while between-bundle comparisons were evaluated using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. A total of 23 hospitals (62%) were in the urban region, while 14 hospitals (38%) were located in rural areas. In the obstetrical hemorrhage bundle, Readiness domain had significantly higher implementation than Recognition and Prevention (p = 0.0005) and Reporting and Systems Learning domains (p < 0.0001). In the severe hypertension bundle, Readiness (p < 0.0001), Recognition and Prevention (p = 0.0035), and Response (p < 0.0001) domains all had higher scores than Reporting and Systems Learning domain. The Recognition and Prevention domain had significantly higher implementation in the severe hypertension bundle than in the obstetrical hemorrhage bundle (p = 0.0351). Urban hospitals had significantly higher obstetrical hemorrhage bundle implementation scores than rural hospitals (p = 0.0121). Hospitals with more full-time facility personnel and registered nurses demonstrated better implementation of both obstetrical hemorrhage (facility personnel: p = 0.0454; registered nurses: p = 0.0126) and severe hypertension (facility personnel: p = 0.0180; registered nurses: p = 0.0093) bundles. Readiness components were the most frequently implemented, while Reporting and Systems Learning elements had lower adoption rates. Urban hospitals had higher obstetric hemorrhage bundle implementation levels than rural hospitals. Hospitals with greater staffing resources, particularly full-time facility personnel and registered nurses, demonstrated better implementation of safety bundles.

This study aimed to evaluate the extent of HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination and explore the influencing factors among healthcare providers in western China, in order to inform decision-making regarding the reduction of stigma and discrimination intervention. A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2023 and July 2024, and 24,646 (with a response rate of 98.6%) healthcare providers completed the survey using a concise and standardized instrument, including sociodemographic and work-related characteristics, healthcare institutional policies and guidelines, attitudes and opinions about people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (PLHIV), as well as discriminatory behaviors. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to assess the influencing factors of HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination among healthcare providers. The proportions of healthcare providers expressing concerns about dressing wounds and drawing blood were 65.1% and 60.3%, respectively. Approximately 40% of the participants believed that most PLHIV did not care if they infected others and had multiple sexual partners. Healthcare providers experienced more secondary stigma and discrimination in the provision of services to PLHIV than direct stigma and discrimination against PLHIV. 67.1% of the respondents agreed that PLHIV should be allowed to have babies if they wish. 71-98% indicated that their institutions had related policies and guidelines to protect HIV/AIDS patients from discrimination. HIV/AIDS-related discriminatory behaviors were higher among healthcare providers who had lower levels of education and training, worked in private or infectious disease hospitals or hospitals with inadequate policies, provided face to face services to PLHIV, and had higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes (P < 0.05). HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination among healthcare providers were prevalent in western China. The factors identified in the study which were associated with higher HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination may provide valuable insights for mitigating these negative associations, and more coordinated and multifaceted approaches and interventions need to be implemented to effectively reduce HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings.",

        "title": "The establishment of lipid profiles reference ranges during pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Maternal lipid levels, which are crucial for both foetal development and maternal health, exhibit significant physiological changes during pregnancy. Current reference ranges for lipids that are based on common adults may inadequately assess the appropriate lipid levels during pregnancy and fail to predict potential risks. Therefore, it is necessary to establish trimester-specific reference intervals (TSRIs) for pregnant women during pregnancy. To establish TSRIs for total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels during pregnancy and to explore potential factors influencing lipid levels. Following PRISMA/MOOSE guidelines, 13 observational studies (54,517 healthy women with singleton pregnancies) were included and analyzed. The pooled means and associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using a random effects model, and the TSRIs for women with singleton pregnancies were calculated using a frequentist approach. The quality of the included studies was appraised by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) scale. The established TSRIs for the women with singleton pregnancies during the first, second, and third trimesters were 3.00-5.83, 3.79-7.87, and 4.39-8.98 mmol/L for TC; 0.08-2.27, 0.39-3.90, and 0.82-5.00 mmol/L for TG; 0.86-2.34, 0.80-2.69, and 0.83-2.58 mmol/L for HDL-c; and 1.16-3.56, 1.51-5.04, and 1.90-5.74 mmol/L for LDL-c, respectively. The TSRIs applicable to Chinese women with singleton pregnancies were 2.96-5.66, 3.79-7.63 and 4.36-8.69 mmol/L for TC; 0.22-2.05, 0.56-4.08 and 1.10-5.15 mmol/L for TG; 1.01-2.35, 0.84-2.66 and 0.67-2.72 mmol/L for HDL-c; and 1.12-3.38, 1.39-4.94 and 1.79-5.60 mmol/L for LDL-c for the first, second, and third trimesters. Compared with pregnant women from Asia, European and South American pregnant women showed higher serum third-trimester TC level and lower second-trimester TG and third-trimester TG and LDL-c levels. Studies using enzyme colorimetry method reported higher second-trimester TG and third-trimester TG and HDL-c levels than those using enzyme methods. In addition, the third-trimester TC, HDL-c, LDL-c and three-trimesters TG levels were significantly higher as reported by the studies conducted before 2015 than by the ones conducted after 2015. The appropriate establishment of TSRIs is essential for accurate diagnosis of dyslipidaemia during pregnancy, which may be affected by the inhabited regions where pregnant women lived, the assay methods and the years when study conducted. Further region-specific and method-specific TSRIs for women with singleton pregnancies using the latest data are needed in order to enhance the diagnostic capability of dyslipidaemia in pregnant women during three trimesters.",

        "abstract": "Malaria and malnutrition adversely affect maternal and neonatal health in Sub-Saharan Africa. While intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) is widely used to reduce malaria incidence, the potential additional benefits of combining it with lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) remain unclear. The objective of this review was to systematically summarize the evidence on the effects of LNS in combination with IPTp on malaria incidence, maternal nutritional status, and birth outcomes. A comprehensive search of 4 databases-MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and CENTRAL-and the gray literature via GOOGLE Scholar-was conducted in January 2024, and updated in July 2024. The review followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines and included studies assessing LNS and IPTp for outcomes related to malaria, nutritional status, or birth outcomes. The review identified 17 studies, focused on 5 main trials: 2 with small-quantity LNS (SQ-LNS), 2 with balanced energy-protein (BEP), and 1 trial with large-quantity LNS (LQ-LNS). LNS supplementation did not significantly affect malaria incidence, anemia, or nutritional status. However, some studies reported improvements in birth outcomes, particularly among specific subgroups and those with baseline undernutrition. Variability in study methodologies and supplementation protocols influenced these findings. While LNS and IPTp show potential for improving selected birth outcomes, the evidence for their effect on malaria incidence or maternal anemia remains inconclusive. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of LNS and IPTp among vulnerable groups of women in malaria-endemic regions.",

Traditionally characterized by high-blood pressure and proteinuria, organ and placental dysfunction were later proposed in some clinical practice guidelines as additional components for its definition. Variability in diagnostic criteria across international guidelines could be a barrier to harmonized and equitable care in different settings. We reviewed current relevant clinical practice guidelines to identify similarities and differences in recommendations related to the definition and diagnosis of preeclampsia, and their supporting evidence. We also reviewed additional systematic reviews related to the diagnosis of preeclampsia. We searched different databases and websites of international and professional organizations for guidelines published or updated from 2014 to 2024. We searched databases to identify additional systematic reviews on preeclampsia diagnosis. Fifteen guidelines from 11 organizations were identified with 11 systematic reviews supporting evidence on the diagnosis of preeclampsia. We found 21 additional systematic reviews, not included in these guidelines. There is agreement for hypertension and proteinuria for the diagnosis of preeclampsia, without a uniform consensus on methods and devices for their assessment. Organ dysfunction is considered in eight guidelines and placental dysfunction in four, with some disagreements on their usefulness, and the methods and tools for their measurement. Few guidelines support their recommendations on preeclampsia diagnosis with systematic reviews. Consensus in preeclampsia definition is needed to guide not only clinical practice but also future research and policy, particularly in global health contexts.",

        "abstract": "Cesarean section is commonly linked to significant postoperative pain, which may hinder maternal recovery. Transversalis fascia plane block (TFPB) has emerged as a regional anesthesia technique that may enhance pain control and reduce opioid requirements. This study assesses the efficacy and safety of TFPB through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Following PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251000597), a systematic search of five databases was conducted up to March 7, 2025. Included studies were randomized controlled trials comparing TFPB with placebo, no block, or other regional techniques such as transversus abdominis plane block, quadratus lumborum block, or ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric nerve blocks. Outcomes reflecting analgesic efficacy included time to first analgesic request, pain scores (at rest and during movement), 24-hour opioid consumption, and the proportion of patients requiring rescue analgesia. Opioid-related side effects were also assessed. Ten randomized controlled trials were included. TFPB significantly prolonged the time to first analgesic request compared to control or alternative techniques (SMD=2.328; 95% CI: 0.487 to 4.169; P=0.003) and reduced the need for rescue analgesia (OR=0.373; 95% CI: 0.172 to 0.81; P=0.013). Although the reduction in 24-hour opioid consumption was not statistically significant overall (SMD=-1.052; 95% CI: -2.549 to 0.445; P=0.169), subgroup analyses indicated benefit in selected settings. At 12 hours postoperatively, TFPB significantly reduced pain scores compared to placebo, both at rest (MD: -1.00; 95% CI: -1.756 to -0.244) and during movement (MD: -1.000; 95% CI: -1.749 to -0.251). TFPB offers effective postoperative analgesia and reduces opioid use after cesarean section, with a safety profile comparable to other regional techniques.",

        "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is characterised by glucose intolerance identified during pregnancy, typically resolving postpartum. Globally, the standardised prevalence is 14%. Dietary management is essential in mitigating adverse maternal and infant outcomes, with guidelines recommending low- or no-carbohydrate snacks to stabilise blood glucose concentrations. However, the influence of snacking patterns on glycaemic outcomes in women with GDM has yet to be assessed by systematic review. Following PRISMA guidelines, this review examines the association between snacking patterns, specifically timing, frequency, and composition, and glycaemia in this population. Electronic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Maternity and Infant Care (MIDIRS), and CINAHL in April 2024, with an updated search performed in June 2025. Reference lists and citations were also screened. Studies examining the impact of snacking on glycaemia in women with GDM were included. Of the 7405 articles identified, five studies met the inclusion criteria: four 1-8-week intervention studies and one 7-day observational study. The included studies showed considerable heterogeneity in their designs. Evidence for a relationship between snacking and glycaemia in GDM was mixed, with some studies suggesting glycaemic benefits from snacking, including bedtime snacking, while others found that bedtime snacks adversely influenced glycaemia. Any association between snacking and glycaemia in individuals with GDM remains inconclusive due to limited available data, study heterogeneity, and conflicting results. The lack of high-quality studies underscores the need for further research to define the role of snacking in glycaemia among this population.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a standardized blood pressure (BP) chart and neonatal hypotension management guidelines on inotrope use and clinical outcomes in preterm infants.Retrospective cohort study of preterm infants (<32 weeks gestational age (GA)) at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We compared data before (EPOCH1) and after (EPOCH2) implementing the BP chart and hypotension guidelines. Extracted variables included maternal/neonatal characteristics, inotrope use, morbidity, and mortality. Statistical significance was set at <i>p</i> < 0.05.Among 384 infants (192 per epoch), overall inotrope use declined significantly in EPOCH2 (33.9 vs. 17.7%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). In the hypotension subgroup, EPOCH1 infants had higher GA, birth weight, and 5- and 10-minute APGAR scores. After implementation, dopamine (58.5 vs. 14.7%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and fluid bolus (80 vs. 41.2%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) use decreased, whereas norepinephrine (26.2 vs. 70.6%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and hydrocortisone (46.2 vs. 82.4%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) increased. Inotrope therapy was triggered at lower mean arterial pressure and systolic/diastolic thresholds; duration of inotrope use also dropped (4.2 vs. 2.6 days, <i>p</i> < 0.034). Periventricular leukomalacia rates fell (15.1 vs. 6.5%, <i>p</i> < 0.007), with no significant differences in overall mortality, intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, or necrotizing enterocolitis. However, early mortality (<72 hours) in hypotensive infants was reduced (64.3 vs. 26.7%, <i>p</i> < 0.042).The implementation of BP charts and hypotension management guidelines was associated with a significant reduction in the use of inotropes and fluid boluses, indicating a more standardized and objective approach to BP management in preterm infants. These changes reflect improved clinical decision-making based on defined BP thresholds, resulting in greater consistency in the timing and selection of interventions while potentially minimizing the risks linked to unnecessary cardiovascular support. · Blood pressure charts may improve treatment decisions for neonatal hypotension.. · Hypotension often occurs in preterm infants and can significantly affect their morbidity and mortality.. · Pathophysiology-based management of neonatal hypotension may reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality..",

The ARMADA Taskforce-an international, multidisciplinary expert panel-undertook a systematic review to develop LAmAbs consensus recommendations for RSV disease prevention in children. The Taskforce recommends LAmAbs for all infants aged <8 months in the absence of maternal RSV vaccination, preterm infants (<37 weeks' gestational age) aged <12 months, and children <24 months with high-risk conditions. Seasonal LAmAb administration is recommended, although in RSV-endemic countries decisions should be made locally concerning administration year-round or with peak RSV incidences. The Taskforce strongly endorses LAmAbs implementation based on their efficacy, effectiveness, and public health impact. These recommendations provide a blueprint to inform guidelines worldwide. Wider equitable access to LAmAbs at affordable prices, especially in low- and middle-income countries is needed to reduce the childhood RSV burden.",

        "abstract": "Obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIs) constitute a significant complication in vaginal childbirth, affecting up to 26% of deliveries and representing the leading cause of anal incontinence among women. Despite their prevalence and serious long-term consequences, OASIs remain widely underreported, partly because of clinicians' hesitancy linked to fear of litigation, peer criticism, and a pervasive culture that discourages disclosure of adverse events. Recent evidence emphasizes that underreporting exacerbates rather than mitigates legal risks and patient harm, underscoring the urgent need for systemic changes. This article reviews critical factors contributing to OASI underreporting, including inadequate clinical training, inconsistent national guidelines, variable litigation landscapes, and differing diagnostic practices across European healthcare systems. Examples from the UK, Poland, Sweden, Norway, France, Italy, the Czech Republic, and Belgium demonstrate significant variations in prevention strategies, diagnostic accuracy, and management protocols, reflecting uneven progress and highlighting opportunities for standardized care improvements. These national discrepancies in OASI definitions, classification, and reporting thresholds may lead to significant inconsistencies in both clinical outcomes and statistical comparisons across healthcare systems. Implementing structured training, standardized protocols, multidisciplinary collaboration, and transparent reporting systems are essential for improving maternal outcomes and reducing litigation risks. Encouraging an institutional culture of accountability and openness will support continuous improvement, ensuring enhanced patient safety and quality care across global healthcare systems.",

        "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a prevalent and severe pregnancy-related complication, for which effective intervention targets remain limited, posing significant risks to maternal and fetal health. This study aimed to identify potential therapeutic target genes through genetic analyses. Specifically, we utilized cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) of druggable genes derived from blood samples obtained from the eQTLGen consortium as exposure data. Subsequently, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to explore causal associations between these druggable genes and PE. Functional enrichment analysis, Summary-data-based MR (SMR), and colocalization analysis were employed to validate the identified genes. MR results revealed 17 druggable genes significantly associated with PE after multiple testing correction (FDR < 0.05). Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these genes are involved in key biological processes such as leukocyte proliferation and activation, immune response regulation, and the metabolism of water-soluble vitamins. Additionally, they were found to participate in several critical signaling pathways, including the complement and coagulation cascades, the renin-angiotensin system, and folate biosynthesis. SMR and colocalization analyses further confirmed the causal relationships between PE and five genes-TESK2, LNPEP, CD320, NELL2, and SF3B3. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing data supported the association between the expression levels of TESK2, CD320, and SF3B3 and the development of PE. This study provides preliminary evidence identifying several potential genetic targets that may help reduce the risk of PE from a genomic perspective. These findings offer novel scientific insights and research directions for future drug development and the optimization of therapeutic strategies aimed at managing and preventing PE.",

We integrated metabolomic analysis of umbilical cord plasma and transcriptomic analysis of cord plasma-exposed hepatocytes to examine differences in the intrauterine environment of pregnancies with and without maternal obesity. We identified significantly higher abundance of fatty acids, bioactive lipids, and upregulation of glutathione metabolism in cord plasma from pregnancies with obesity compared to normal weight pregnancies. Hepatocytes exposed to cord plasma from pregnancies with obesity exhibited distinct transcriptional changes that favored cellular injury and inflammation, and impaired hepatocyte development compared to hepatocytes exposed to cord plasma of normal weight pregnancies. In integrated analysis, metabolite-gene relationships were distinct between pregnancies with and without obesity, and the abundance of lipids were positively correlated with the expression of KDM4D, DTX3, and NOTCH4 and negatively correlated with the expression of MT_TS1. Our findings provide novel insights into transcriptional changes induced in hepatocytes by circulating factors in the intrauterine environment of pregnancies with obesity.

Investigating ferroptosis-related characteristic genes and potential therapeutic compounds may enhance asthma management. This study employed differential analysis and machine learning to identify ferroptosis-related characteristic genes in asthma using the GSE179156 dataset and FerrDb V2 database. Immune infiltration analysis explored the associations between these genes and immune cells, while potential small-molecule drugs were screened through the Connectivity Map (CMap) database and evaluated via molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Two ferroptosis-related characteristic genes, AGPS and APELA, were identified, with AGPS upregulated and APELA downregulated in asthma, both significantly correlated with various immune cells. A diagnostic model based on these genes demonstrated high predictive accuracy. Additionally, KU-55933 was identified as a potential small-molecule inhibitor of AGPS, with stable binding confirmed through computational simulations. These findings emphasize the role of ferroptosis-related genes in asthma and propose promising therapeutic candidates, providing novel insights into its diagnosis and treatment.",

Phase 1 involved three expert interviews and insights from scientific literature on postpartum PA. Phase 2 comprised two co-creation workshops with stakeholders representing postpartum women and various healthcare professionals (HCPs) from Danish maternity care. Data from both phases were analysed thematically. Expert interviews (phase 1) revealed three themes: (i) approaches to discussing PA with postpartum women, (ii) roles and competencies of various HCPs in postpartum PA support, and (iii) interdisciplinary collaboration. In the workshops (phase 2), stakeholders identified two optimal time points for delivering PA support: during the third trimester and at two months postpartum. PA barriers were identified at the structural, interpersonal, and individual levels. Co-created strategies included (i) screening and early identification of needs, (ii) varying competencies and roles of HCPs, (iii) PA support arenas, (iv) motivation and engagement, and (v) national postpartum PA guidelines. The findings of this study offer insight into embedding PA support in existing maternity healthcare touchpoints. Interdisciplinary coordination, targeted support for those most in need, and a shared professional understanding of postpartum PA are highlighted as important to strengthen postpartum PA support in maternity care.",

Their metal content is influenced by environmental factors (e.g., industrial areas, mining sites) and individual factors (e.g., maternal diet, early nutrition, passive smoking). The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxic metal content in deciduous teeth and to identify factors contributing to its accumulation, as well as possible health implications. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines and following the PICO framework. Quality assessment was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for quasi-experimental studies. The literature search was carried out in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using the following keywords: deciduous, milk, primary, decidua, teeth, dentition, heavy metal, toxic metals. A total of 134 articles were initially identified, with 95 remaining after duplicate removal. After screening, 75 articles were excluded: 71 did not meet the inclusion criteria, 3 were not available in English, and 1 lacked full-text access. Ultimately, 20 studies were included in the review. Toxic metal concentrations were determined using various analytical techniques, mainly inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Higher levels of metals, especially lead, were observed in the teeth of children residing in industrial areas, near mines, or in regions affected by armed conflict. Although two out of five studies indicated a possible link between fathers' smoking habits and elevated lead concentrations, no definitive relationship was established between secondhand smoke exposure and the levels of lead and cadmium found in dental tissue. Similarly, no definitive relationship was identified between mercury and lead content and the prevalence of autism. However, lower manganese levels were associated with the presence of autistic traits, weaker verbal performance, and reduced memory capacity. In conclusion, deciduous teeth represent a valuable biological material for assessing chronic prenatal and early postnatal exposure to toxic metals, which may serve as a starting point for further research into diseases of unknown etiology, such as autism, and in the future may have clinical significance in their prevention and treatment. And it is also important for monitoring environmental pollution levels.",

        "abstract": "Early-life brain injuries are major causes of long-term neurodevelopmental disorders such as cerebral palsy. Emerging evidence suggests these injuries can alter the gut microbiota composition, intestinal integrity, and neuroinflammatory responses. This systematic review evaluated the impact of early-life brain injuries on the gut microbiota in rodent models. A scientific literature search was conducted across Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase. Initially, 7419 records were identified, and 21 eligible studies were included. Eligible studies focused on evaluating the microbiota alterations and related gut-brain axis markers at the neonatal or post-weaning stages. The data extraction and synthesis followed PRISMA guidelines. Most studies reported gut dysbiosis characterized by a decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes, and <i>Lactobacillus</i>. Alterations were associated with an increased gut permeability, reduced tight junction proteins, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines. Several studies showed reduced levels of short-chain fatty acids and metabolic pathway disruptions. Brain outcomes included neuroinflammation, white matter injury, altered gene expression, and impaired structural integrity. These results suggest that early-life brain injury induces complex alterations in the gut microbiota and its metabolic products, which may contribute to systemic and neuroinflammatory processes. Understanding these interactions offers insights into the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders and highlights the gut-brain axis as a potential target for early interventions.",

        "abstract": "This study explores associations of maternal organic food consumption and diet quality during pregnancy with pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk in offspring, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Pregnant mothers and their offspring were enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort, a nationwide prospective cohort study, in 1996-2002. In gestational week 30, telephone interviews assessed overall maternal organic food consumption during pregnancy. In gestational week 25, a food frequency questionnaire assessed maternal diet during the previous 4 weeks, including six different organic food types (eggs, dairy, meat, fruit, vegetables, and cereals). A Healthy Eating Index evaluated maternal diet quality based on adherence to Danish official dietary guidelines. Offspring with pediatric-onset IBD (≤18 years) were identified in national patient registries. Cox regression explored associations of maternal organic food consumption and diet quality during pregnancy with offspring's risk of pediatric-onset IBD, CD, and UC. The study included 60,274 singleton mother-child pairs, of which 168 children developed pediatric-onset IBD. Frequent maternal organic food consumption during pregnancy was not significantly associated with offspring's IBD risk (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.33-1.19). However, frequent organic food consumption during pregnancy, particularly organic eggs and dairy, lowered offspring's risk of CD (HR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.17-0.94), but not UC (HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.41-3.00). Maternal diet quality during pregnancy was not significantly associated with offspring's risk of IBD (HR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.97-1.01), CD, and UC. In this large prospective cohort study, we show that maternal organic food consumption, particularly eggs and dairy, during pregnancy may lower offspring's risk of pediatric-onset CD, but not UC.",

        "abstract": "Supportive supervision of community health workers (CHWs) is considered a promising intervention for optimizing efficiency and health systems outcomes. However, little is known about how supportive supervision is conceptualized and implemented across maternal and child health (MCH) programs in India. We examined the scope of supportive supervision in selected MCH programs. We analyzed 29 programmatic documents and implementation guidelines from seven programs, and identified and extracted data on several themes, such as conceptualization, operationalization, monitoring and evaluation, and quality assurance of supportive supervision according to a pre-determined domain-based template. We found notable differences in the scope and quality of supportive supervision offered under different programs. Many programs did not include supportive supervision as a supervisory modality. Programs which included supportive supervision did not define all the parameters of operationalization - responsible workforce, frequency of visits, procedure, training, logistic support, supervision formats/checklists, scope for and frequency of monitoring and evaluation, and quality assurance of supervisory visits. Even when some parameters were defined, there was considerable heterogeneity in implementation across programs. Such inconsistencies may adversely affect the quality and efficiency of supportive supervision, thereby minimizing its potential. Policymakers should prioritize the redesign of supportive supervision strategies to ensure greater clarity and consistency across key domains, thereby optimizing community health worker performance and strengthening public health program outcomes.",

Pregnant individuals (n = 351) enrolled in Louisiana's Women, Infants, and Children program were randomly assigned to a multicomponent eHealth Intervention or Usual Care. Fat percentage, fat mass, and fat-free mass were assessed using bioelectrical impedance at trimester-specific study visits. Mixed models evaluated within- and between-group differences in body composition from early to late pregnancy: overall, by BMI, and by gestational weight gain (GWG) guideline attainment. Effects of body composition changes on perinatal outcomes was evaluated. Compared to Usual Care (n = 172), the Intervention Group (n = 179) had attenuated gains in fat mass, fat mass index, and fat percentage from early to late pregnancy overall, in individuals who had normal weight at enrollment, and in those who exceeded GWG guidelines (p < 0.05). No significant between-group differences in fat-free mass were observed. Fat mass change interacted with intervention effects on neonatal health outcomes (p = 0.01). Lifestyle interventions during pregnancy may attenuate gestational fat mass gain, particularly among women with normal weight and those who exceed GWG guidelines, with potential implications for neonatal health outcomes.

        "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a growing public health concern, influencing pregnancy outcomes and long-term health for pregnant people and infants.1-3 Effective dietary management of GDM is critical for preventing complications.4 This narrative review evaluates the effectiveness of various dietary interventions in managing GDM, including Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), low glycemic index, plant-based, Mediterranean, and energy-restricted diets. The review assesses the results from 14 published studies, including randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. The DASH diet was associated with significant benefits in reducing HbA1c levels, improving lipid profiles, and decreasing the rates of cesarean sections and macrosomia. Low glycemic index diets improved postprandial glucose levels and reduced insulin requirements, though findings regarding overall glycemic control and pregnancy outcomes were conflicting. Plant-based diets were associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced inflammation, offering substantial maternal and neonatal health benefits. The Mediterranean diet was associated with reduced GDM incidence and improved metabolic health. Energy-restricted diets did not outperform standard care GDM diets that were focused on balanced macronutrient intake to meet nutritional needs of the pregnant person and fetus. These findings highlight the importance of dietary composition and quality in GDM management. Among the diets assessed, DASH appears most effective for glycemic control and improved pregnancy outcomes. Although the Mediterranean diet shares features with DASH, evidence for its efficacy in treating GDM is limited. Low glycemic index and plant-based diets also show promise in glycemic control. Further research is needed to establish standardized dietary guidelines for GDM management. High-quality studies, particularly randomized controlled trials comparing dietary patterns, are essential to optimize nutritional guidance for individuals with or at risk of GDM.",

This narrative review discusses factors that may explain the observed gap between guideline recommendations and clinical practice, including recent findings from the field that help clarify this poor adherence. We highlight the discrepancy between guideline-based recommendations and clinical implementation. We also discuss the evolving landscape of bronchiolitis management, including evidence supporting novel interventions such as maternal RSV vaccination during pregnancy and the use of monoclonal antibodies like nirsevimab and ziresovir, an oral RSV F protein inhibitor. Understanding and addressing the causes of poor adherence to bronchiolitis guidelines is critical. Future research should aim to integrate evidence-based treatments with options for personalized adjustments.

This study analyses the trend in availability of and health facility readiness to provide high-quality ANC in Burkina Faso between 2012 and 2020, a period spanning the introduction of user-fee exemption policy and conflict in several regions. We conducted a trend analysis of repeated cross-sectional health facility data using the nationally representative Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) surveys conducted in 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018 and the census-based 2020 Health Harmonized Facilities Assessment (HHFA). We used tracer indicators defined by both surveys to characterize availability of services and health facility readiness. Availability and readiness indices were calculated using the equal-weighted approach, and the domain-weighted approach was used for readiness only. Trends were assessed using weighted multivariate linear regression. The number of health facilities surveyed was 686 in 2012, 766 in 2014, 677 in 2016, 794 in 2018 and 2,728 in 2020. ANC availability decreased from 72.2% in 2012 to 70.9% by 2020 in a statistically significant decreasing trend ([Formula: see text]. For health facilities in rural locations, there was a statistically significant improvement in the ANC availability ([Formula: see text] while for those in urban settings, there was an overall statistically significant decreasing trend ([Formula: see text]. For ANC service readiness, there was also a statistically significant decline after adjustments for health facility characteristics ([Formula: see text]). Adjusted readiness score for staff and guidelines significantly decreased during the study period ([Formula: see text], while the adjusted score of other domains (equipment ([Formula: see text], diagnosis ([Formula: see text], and medicines ([Formula: see text] significantly increased. For both outcomes, there were regional disparities with Est showing statistically significant incremental changes and Centre Sud showing statistically significant declining trends. This study shows decreases in ANC service availability and readiness between 2012 and 2020 in Burkina Faso. In the context of the implementation of global recommendations regarding ANC services and ongoing conflict in the country disrupting the health system, there is an urgent need to pay attention to ANC service strengthening, particularly the availability of trained health personnel and guidelines at all levels of the healthcare system, especially public health facilities in urban settings.

        "abstract": "Breastfeeding is a critical health equalizer and predictor of significant maternal and infant health outcomes, profoundly influenced by the socioeconomic and cultural status of mothers. Previous research has suggested that migration negatively impacts the breastfeeding practices of immigrant mothers. Given that Iran hosts approximately 3 million Afghan refugees, this study aimed to compare the breastfeeding practices of immigrant Afghan mothers in Iran with those of Iranian mothers. This prospective cohort study included postpartum Iranian mothers (n = 209) and Afghan immigrant mothers (n = 327) referred to Nekuei Hedayati Forqani Hospital in Qom and Imam Khomeini Hospital complex in Tehran from January 1, 2023, to May 1, 2023. Breastfeeding quality was assessed using the Bristol Breastfeeding Assessment Tool (BBAT) at baseline (after birth) and at 2-, 4-, and 6-month follow-ups. Breastfeeding continuity was qualitatively assessed based on mothers' reports of daily frequency and duration of breastfeeding episodes over six months. The mean BBAT score of the Iranian cohort was significantly higher than that of Afghan mothers at baseline (7.0 ± 1.5 vs. 6.7 ± 1.7; P-value = 0.032) and at the 6-month follow-up (7.7 ± 0.5 vs. 7.1 ± 1.3; P-value < 0.001), with no significant differences at 2- and 4-month follow-ups (P-values > 0.05). Additionally, the Iranian cohort demonstrated a higher frequency of daily breastfeeding episodes (P-value = 0.001) and longer mean duration per episode compared to the Afghan cohort (P-value < 0.001). Our findings suggested that Afghan immigrant mothers tend to have poorer breastfeeding practices than Iranian mothers, which highlights the need for Iran's healthcare system to offer a multicultural, accessible, educational, and supportive framework to improve these outcomes. Nonetheless, our relatively small sample size, significant sociodemographic disparities between the Iranian and Afghan cohorts, and restriction to urban sampling may limit the generalizability of our results. Future research would benefit from larger, longitudinal studies with nationally representative samples that systematically examine how socioeconomic factors influence breastfeeding practices among Afghan migrant populations in Iran.

This disease is becoming more common in children and adolescents and can result in symptoms like swallowing difficulties, food impaction and abdominal pain. Managing pediatric EoE requires a team effort including gastroenterologists, allergists and dietitians. Medical treatments may include topical corticosteroids, proton pump inhibitors, and elimination diets. Endoscopy plays a key role in the diagnosis, management and monitoring of the condition. The management of pediatric EoE is distinct from that of adult EoE, due to differences in anatomy, physiology and treatment options. Thus, it is recommended that children with EoE see a pediatric gastroenterologist when possible. However, adult gastroenterologists can also contribute to the management of pediatric EoE when a pediatric gastroenterologist is not accessible. A guideline for the management of pediatric EoE in Italy has been created by Italian Society of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (SIGENP) to encourage collaboration between adult gastroenterologists and pediatricians, and it has been endorsed by major adult gastroenterology Italian societies including AIGO, SIGE and SIED, highlighting the importance of collaboration in the diagnosis and management of pediatric EoE.",

        "abstract": "Uterine torsion is a pregnancy pathology that poses risks to both maternal and fetal health. This condition is closely associated with the relaxation of uterine ligaments due to hormonal changes and the increased size of the gravid uterus. It occurs when the uterus rotates around its own axis. This torsion can result in ischemia, and if untreated, may progress to necrosis and fetal loss. Folic acid has protective effects against oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of folic acid to reduce ischemia‒reperfusion (IR) injury in the rat uterus. IR caused severe edema, inflammation, congestion, hemorrhage, vasoconstriction, and necrosis in the uterus. Histopathological damage was less pronounced in rats treated with folic acid. Although the endometrial layer, critical for fertility, suffered significant damage, folic acid effectively prevented this injury. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that caspase-3 activity, a marker of apoptosis, increased in response to IR. However, folic acid treatment attenuated this activity, and uterine inflammation also reduced. High-dose folic acid inhibited TNF-alpha immunoreactivity. Interestingly, folic acid did not activate antioxidant mechanisms to reduce oxidative stress. Nevertheless, it mitigated IR-induced damage by reducing endometrial injury and preventing inflammation and apoptosis. As a result, uterine torsion can lead to endometrial damage, degeneration, inflammation, and apoptosis, potentially affecting fertility. High-dose folic acid treatment may protect the uterus from these damages, thereby preserving fertility. This study suggests that folic acid, particularly at high doses, may be safe and beneficial treatment to prevent IR damage and promote uterine health.",

        "abstract": "Environmental exposures, particularly pesticides, have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Additionally, children who are HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental delays. However, there is limited research exploring the combined effects of HIV/antiretroviral therapy (ART) exposure and pesticide exposure, especially in children from agricultural communities in Southern and Eastern Africa. This systematic review investigates the potential impact of pesticide exposure on neurodevelopmental outcomes in HEU children from these regions. A systematic review methodology was employed, following PRISMA guidelines. Studies published between 2008 and July 2024 were retrieved from databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, AJOL, conference proceedings, and grey literature. The review focused on children born to smallholder horticultural farmers exposed to both maternal HIV/ART and environmental pesticides. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO. Boolean operators and tailored search strategies were used to identify relevant literature. Of 1,324 articles screened, 21 met the inclusion criteria. Most studies reported significant neurodevelopmental effects linked to pesticide exposure, with cognitive delays being the most frequently reported outcome. Children exposed to both pesticides and maternal HIV/ART exhibited increased risks of attention deficits and delayed milestones. Due to high heterogeneity in study design, populations, and outcome measures, meta-analysis was not feasible. South Africa showed the highest dual exposure burden, raising concerns about synergistic neurodevelopmental harm. The review highlights strong evidence linking organophosphate exposure and certain ART regimens to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes such as ADHD and cognitive impairment in HEU children. Yet, few studies have evaluated their combined effects. Findings from Southern and Eastern Africa suggest a convergence of neurotoxic risks. Multidisciplinary, region-specific research is urgently needed to clarify the interactions between pesticide exposure and HIV/ART in early childhood neurodevelopment.

This systematic review and Meta -analysis aimed to assess the pooled effect of physical exercise during pregnancy on delivery outcomes. We conducted a systematic literature search on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Embase, Scopus, HINARI, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and backward and forward citations for studies published since 2010. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English, assessing the effect of exercise on the mode of delivery as a primary or secondary outcome, were included. Quality assessment was performed using Cochrane guidelines, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. A random-effects model was used for meta-analysis, and results were reported as risk ratio (RR) and weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistics, and potential publication bias was examined. The primary outcome was the mode of delivery, while secondary outcomes included duration of labor, Apgar score, and birth weight. A total of 16 RCTs involving 3,387 women (1,704 exercise and 1,683 control)were included. Compared to the control group, pregnant women with exercise interventions had a higher rate of normal vaginal delivery (RR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.08-1.21, I² = 25.6%, moderate certainty of evidence) and a significantly lower rate of cesarean delivery (RR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.55-0.80, I² = 22.47%, high certainty of evidence). However, no statistically significant association was found between exercise and instrumental delivery (RR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.70-1.02, moderate certainty of evidence). The mean duration of the first stage of labor was significantly shorter in the exercise group (WMD = -61.30 minutes, 95% CI: -80.63 to -41.97, moderate certainty of evidence). However, no significant differences were observed for second stage of labor birth weight, Apgar scores at one and five minutes (moderate certainty of evidence). This systematic review and meta-analysis consolidate existing evidence, demonstrating that physical exercise is associated with an increased likelihood of normal vaginal delivery, a reduced rate of cesarean delivery, and a shorter first stage of labor. These findings reinforce the importance of encouraging pregnant women without contraindications to engage in appropriate physical activity during pregnancy, contributing to informing clinical practice.

        "title": "Estimating the impact of maternal anemia on low-birth-weight in Sub-Saharan African countries: propensity score matching analysis.",
        "abstract": "Low birth weight is the main cause of death, illness, and disability in infancy and childhood and has a lasting effect on adult healing here are several studies that indicate the correlation between low birth weight and anemia using an observational study based on the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) but there are limited studies to show the direct effect of anemia on low birth weight. Therefore, we used the propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis to estimate the actual impact of maternal anemia on low birth weight babies. The study aims to reveal the effect of maternal anemia on low birth weight babies among reproductive-age women using propensity score matching analysis from the Demographic and Health Survey in Sub-Saharan Africa. Pregnancy-related maternal nutritional deficiencies impact the fetus’s development, which in turn affects the newborn’s birth weight. The initiative to conduct this study is that most of the time mothers suffer from anemia and at the same time they deliver low birth weight children. LBW newborns had a 20-fold increased risk of morbidity and death compared to normal. Despite the burden of maternal anemia on low birth weight the direct relation with controlling other factors to show their direct cause and effect is not well studied. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted based on the DHS data. We used the recent DHS data of 27 Sub-Saharan African countries. A total of 54,904 women with at least one birth in the last five years were considered. To estimate the impact of anemia on low birth weight, we used PSM analysis with a logit model using psmatch2 ate STATA command to find the average treatment effect on the population (ATE), treated and untreated. The quality of matching was assessed statistically and graphically. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of the PSM estimates using the Mantel- Haenszel test statistic. The prevalence of anemia in sub-Saharan Africa was 41.62%. The prevalence rate of low birth weight was 20.1%. In the PSM analysis, the difference in ATE of anemia on low birth weight was 13.0%. The difference in ATE among the treated group was 2.44% increased risk of low birth weight. The ATE in the treated group had a 12.1% increased risk of low birth weight. The estimates were insensitive to hidden bias and had a good quality of matching. Anemia has a strong effect on low birth weight after matching treated and control groups of observed variables. Reducing maternal anemia for improved birth outcomes or increasing fetal birth weight requires treating anemia before and during the early stages of pregnancy, as well as providing regular nutrition instruction and counseling during routine ANC follow-up. The involvement of stakeholders in the treatment of anemia is warranted to decrease the rate of LBW and its late consequences.",

        "title": "Assessing patient-level risk factors for evidence-based early diagnosis of maternal sepsis.",
        "abstract": "Maternal sepsis is a leading cause of maternal death, with the burden higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Early Warning Systems (EWS) combine clinical observations to identify a pattern consistent with an increased risk of clinical deterioration and have been introduced for monitoring sepsis risk. Maternal sepsis risks in LMICs are driven by factors at the health system and patient levels. This study assessed patient-level risk factors -age, health-seeking behaviour, comorbidities and procedures- associated with maternal sepsis in an urban tertiary hospital in Nigeria. We conducted a retrospective study using health records of 4,510 patients from obstetrics and gynaecology units at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Nigeria from 2016 to 2020. To examine the association between patient-level risk factors and sepsis, we analysed data for the 565 maternal patients with a record of infection using a multiple logistic regression model. We extended the model by introducing interaction terms to assess whether the association between the risk factors and maternal sepsis varied by socio-demographic factors. About one-fifth of the 565 maternal patients with an infection had sepsis. Patients with sepsis had the lowest rate of live birth (29.7%) compared to those with (41.8%) and without (82.1%) an infection. Proportions of stillbirth (intrauterine fetal death) and early neonatal deaths were highest among patients with sepsis (15.3% and 1.8%) compared to those with (13.2% and 2.1%) and without (4.5% and 1.7%) an infection. Antenatal care booking status (OR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.08-0.38) and having a catheter (OR: 2.60; 95% CI: 1.35-5.01) were significantly associated with maternal sepsis in the adjusted model. Our results suggest that improving access to antenatal care services for pregnant women will substantially reduce the risk of maternal sepsis in the Nigerian population. Guidelines for maternal sepsis management should consider subgroups of patients at higher risk, such as those with urethral catheters.",

        "abstract": "Pregnancy in women with a Fontan circulation carries increased risk. Given the relative evidence void, pregnancy counseling requires considerable nuance and experience. This study aimed to identify risk factors for maternal and fetal complications and to contrast risk estimates obtained from existing risk stratification tools, including the modified WHO, CARPREG II, and ZAHARA risk scores. Pregnant women (>20 weeks of gestation) with a Fontan circulation were retrospectively included from 13 international centers. Univariate and multivariable analyses identified predictors of complications, and the performance of risk stratification tools was assessed. From 2006 to 2018, 84 women with Fontan physiology had 108 pregnancies, and form the basis of this investigation. Maternal cardiovascular complications occurred in 32 (30%) of all pregnancies including Fontan circulatory failure (17%), supraventricular tachycardia (7.4%), and thromboembolic events (3.7%). No maternal deaths occurred. Premature birth constituted 68% of neonatal complications, with a fetal and neonatal mortality of 13%. Multivariable analysis linked adverse maternal outcomes to pre-pregnancy oxygen saturation (adjusted OR 0.77; 95%CI 0.61-0.96; p=0.02). None of the risk models showed good discriminative ability. The modified WHO classification was the only risk model significantly associated with adverse fetal outcomes. Pregnancy in women with Fontan circulation poses a significant cardiovascular risk for the mother and a high burden of fetal and neonatal complications. The existing predictive risk stratification models do not discriminate hazard between well-functioning patients with Fontan from those with additional hemodynamic burden. This underscores the necessity for large-scale studies to refine risk stratification.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in four-dimensional (4D) ultrasonography have enabled detailed observation of fetal behavior <i>in utero</i>, including facial movements, limb gestures, and stimulus responses. These developments have prompted renewed inquiry into whether such behaviors are merely reflexive or represent early signs of integrated neural function. However, the relationship between fetal movement patterns and conscious awareness remains scientifically uncertain and ethically contested. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science) were searched for English-language articles published from 2000 to 2025, using keywords including \"fetal behavior,\" \"4D ultrasound,\" \"neurodevelopment,\" and \"consciousness.\" Studies were included if they involved human fetuses, used 4D ultrasound or functional imaging modalities, and offered interpretation relevant to neurobehavioral or ethical analysis. A structured appraisal using AMSTAR-2 was applied to assess study quality. Data were synthesized narratively to map fetal behaviors onto developmental milestones and evaluate their interpretive limits. Seventy-four studies met inclusion criteria, with 23 rated as high-quality. Fetal behaviors such as yawning, hand-to-face movement, and startle responses increased in complexity between 24-34 weeks gestation. These patterns aligned with known neurodevelopmental events, including thalamocortical connectivity and cortical folding. However, no study provided definitive evidence linking observed behaviors to conscious experience. Emerging applications of artificial intelligence in ultrasound analysis were found to enhance pattern recognition but lack external validation. Fetal behavior observed via 4D ultrasound may reflect increasing neural integration but should not be equated with awareness. Interpretations must remain cautious, avoiding anthropomorphic assumptions. Ethical engagement requires attention to scientific limits, sociocultural diversity, and respect for maternal autonomy as imaging technologies continue to evolve.",

        "abstract": "The Electronic Community Health Information System (eCHIS) is a key initiative of Ethiopian government to digitize the Health Extension Program and enhance community health services. Its effective implementation requires identifying key barriers and facilitators to inform tailored strategies. This study employed the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to explore implementation determinants and used the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) to develop context-specific strategies aimed at strengthening eCHIS adoption and sustainability. An exploratory case study design was employed in rural districts of East Shewa Zone, Eastern Ethiopia. Data were collected from November 5 to 25, 2024. A total of 24 face-to-face in-depth interviews were carried out with key informants across multiple sites. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and subsequently translated into English for analysis. Data were coded using Open code 4.03 software and thematically analyzed. Findings were interpreted using the CFIR-ERIC framework. Within the Intervention Characteristics of CFIR domain, barriers included perceptions of eCHIS as an externally imposed system and the lack of interoperability with existing systems. Conversely, the comprehensive design of eCHIS, including integrated job aids, was recognized as a facilitating factor. In the Outer Setting domain, weak community engagement and the absence of clear implementation guidelines were cited as major barriers. For the Inner Setting domain, data synchronization challenges were highlighted as barriers, while the provision of tablets and accessories was identified as a facilitator. Under the Characteristics of Individuals domain, strong self-efficacy and a belief in eCHIS's positive impact on service delivery were noted as facilitators. Finally, in the Implementation Process domain, the lack of planning and leadership engagement was perceived as a barrier, whereas the availability of technical support and feedback mechanisms emerged as critical facilitators. Seven strategies to enhance implementation were developed such as Strengthening leadership engagement, developing clear guideline, fostering community engagement, creating system interoperability, establishing robust feedback systems, integrating health worker incentives program and enhancing technical support. The study offers key insights into the barriers, facilitators, and strategies of eCHIS implementation. Applying these strategies could strengthen implementation, enhance adoption, and promote long-term sustainability.",

        "abstract": "Maternity healthcare costs vary widely due to demographic, pregnancy-related, and clinical factors. Understanding the drivers of extreme costs is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and ensuring equitable access to quality maternal healthcare. This study aimed to identify factors associated with extreme hospital childbirth costs in a tertiary-level hospital in Belgrade, Serbia. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 6,949 women who gave birth in 2019. Maternal age, parity, pregnancy characteristics, delivery method, anesthesia type, perinatal interventions, and comorbidities were analyzed. Costs were categorized as expected or extreme, and multivariate logistic regression identified significant predictors of extreme costs. In our study, 4.1% of mothers required extreme-cost hospitalization and treatment, and these extreme costs were significantly more prevalent among older women, first-time mothers, preterm births, and pregnancies ending in cesarean section. Mothers with extreme costs had a median hospital stay of 23 days compared to 5 days for those with expected costs (p < 0.001). The median total cost of maternity healthcare was 604.3 USD. Women undergoing cesarean delivery had four times higher odds of incurring extreme costs compared to those with spontaneous vaginal delivery. Identifying cost-driving factors in maternity healthcare can improve financial planning and resource distribution in tertiary healthcare settings. Strategies to reduce unnecessary interventions, improve prenatal risk assessment, and optimize hospital stays should be explored to balance cost efficiency with high-quality maternal healthcare.",

        "title": "The experience of a multidisciplinary team in welcoming vulnerable migrants in a rural Italian reception centre: a study using multidimensional textual analysis.",
        "abstract": "In recent years, migration it has significantly increased due to political conflicts, economic instability, and environmental crisis. In migrant reception centers, interdisciplinary collaboration is essential. However, professionals face complex challenges, such as systemic barriers, fragmented services, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and a lack of culturally competent training, particularly in rural contexts where resources are limited. Understanding how professionals navigate the complexities of their roles is crucial. The aim of this study is to explore the experiences of a multidisciplinary team involved in the reception of vulnerable migrants in a rural Italian reception center. A qualitative study with semi-structured interviews was conducted in April 2022 with professionals working in an Italian reception center. The interview questions focused on professionals' experiences, the strengths and challenges of their work, potential improvements to the reception process, the needs and requests reported by migrants, and the priority areas to address, recommended interventions. The data were analyzed using Automatic Analysis of Textual Data, allowing for the identification of latent dimensions and thematic clusters. Correspondence analysis basing on professionals working area, Hierarchical Discending Classification and Principal Component Analysis were conducted. The research report adhered to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) guidelines. The sample consisted of sixteen professionals, divided into three working areas: healthcare, social and organizational. Thematic clusters revealed distinct focuses: socioeducational support emphasized relational and emotional care, healthcare professionals addressed cultural barriers and clinical complexities, and organizational roles concentrated on systemic frameworks and sustainability. Two principal dimensions of care emerged: the cultural dimension of care, which integrates clinical, cultural, and symbolic aspects, and personalized systemic integration planning, highlighting the balance between immediate needs and long-term systemic strategies. The findings underscored the critical importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and culturally sensitive approaches in migrant care. Relational dynamics must be harmonized with systemic planning to address the diverse and evolving needs of beneficiaries. The study also highlights unique challenges in rural contexts, including resource limitations and geographic isolation, which require innovative and context-specific solutions. This study provides context-specific insights that may inform integrated care strategies in similar rural or resource-limited migrant settings. By emphasizing the interplay of cultural, clinical, and systemic dimensions, it offers a framework for improving health outcomes and fostering sustainable integration in both rural and global contexts. Future studies should explore these dynamics across diverse settings to further inform clinical practice, research, and policy development. Not applicable.",

        "abstract": "Maternal health during pregnancy appears to impact childhood cancer risk, yet comprehensive studies remain scarce. This study investigates associations between childhood cancer and multiple maternal comorbidities. A population-based case-control study was conducted using Danish national registers, with maternal health conditions identified from the National Patient Register and Medical Births Registry. We employed the Obstetric Comorbidity Index using ICD-8 and ICD-10 codes. The study population (1977-2013) included 6419 cases and 160484 matched controls. Conditional logistic regression estimated pediatric cancer risk. A maternal comorbidity score of one or more was linked to acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL; OR = 1.07, 95%CI: 1.03-1.12), retinoblastoma (OR = 1.08, 95%CI: 0.94-1.23), and rhabdomyosarcoma (OR = 1.11, 95%CI: 0.98-1.26).

        "title": "The Perinatal Committee report: Review of the progress of obstetric healthcare in Japan.",
        "abstract": "Japan's maternal mortality rate and perinatal mortality rate have shown one of the world's most significant declines, positioning Japan at the global forefront of the lowest levels. The nearly logarithmic annual decline in maternal and perinatal mortality rates suggests that, in addition to advances in medicine and healthcare, various types of care for mothers and newborns have played a crucial role in this achievement. From the period of World War II to the postwar era, up to around 1980, and then every decade thereafter, the events and movements surrounding perinatal healthcare in each era were examined from the perspectives of epidemiology, medical/healthcare advancements, and institutional/policy trends. The major events in each era are outlined as follows: Until around 1980: After World War II, in 1948, several laws were enacted to protect mothers and fetuses, including the Maternal and Child Health Handbook, in 1966. The number of births experienced a baby boom for about 10 years following 1945, peaking in 1973. Birthplaces shifted from home deliveries to medical facilities, with doctors becoming the primary birth attendants. Academically, the Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (JAOG) for Maternal Protection and the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG) were established in 1949. In the medical field, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) were introduced and neonatal transport systems became well-established by the 1970s. In 1976, the limit of viability was revised from under 28 weeks of gestation to under 24 weeks. The late 1970s saw the fetal heart rate monitoring, the heartbeat detection using Doppler ultrasound and the ultrasound imaging techniques. 1980s: The perinatal medicine became well established, leading to hold The Japan Society of Perinatal Medicine. For fetal management, the fields of fetal diagnosis and fetal treatment entered their early stages with the widespread use of fetal heart rate monitoring and ultrasound imaging. In neonatal care, neonatal transport systems to NICU facilities were enhanced. A major breakthrough in this field was the discovery and widespread use of pulmonary surfactant. Two key concepts that emerged and advanced during this period were maternal transport systems and the Perinatal Maternal and Child Center initiative. In 1987, cases of hepatitis caused by non-heat-treated coagulation products became a major issue. As a result, informed consent affecting mothers and fetuses became a significant point of discussion. The Obstetrics and Gynecology Specialist system was introduced, along with the regular publication of Training Notes for Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Glossary of Obstetrics and Gynecology Terms. As a result of these efforts, both the perinatal mortality rate and the maternal mortality rate were reduced by approximately half over the course of 10 years. 1990s: In 1991, the limit of viability was revised to 22 weeks of gestation. In terms of maternal care, nutritional management guidelines for general pregnant women were introduced. In fetal medicine, major topics included the administration of steroids to the mother to promote fetal lung maturation, as well as direct fetal treatments such as shunt procedures and needle aspirations. In neonatal care, inhaled nitric oxide therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment became more widely adopted. Following the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, in 1995, led to the development of the Disaster Medical Assistance Team and the establishment of Perinatal Maternal and Child Medical Center. In 1996, the Maternal Protection Law was enacted, and the Japan Council for Quality Health Care (JCQHC) was founded to standardize medical care. Asia & Oceania Federation of Obstetrics & Gynecology Journal and Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology Research were launched as English-language academic journals. 2000s: Japan's perinatal mortality rate became the lowest in the world, but the maternal mortality rate was still struggling. Obstetric care changed significantly after an obstetrician was arrested for causing a maternal death during a cesarean section. The JSOG and the JAOG developed practice guidelines describing standard obstetric diagnosis and treatments, and the JCQHC established the Japan Obstetric Compensation System for Cerebral Palsy. In addition, a project to report on maternal deaths by JAOG was also launched, and the combination of these measures led to form a framework of professional autonomy for obstetricians. During this period, brain hypothermic therapy for brain injury was developed. 2010s: The Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 led to major changes in disaster medical planning. This included the introduction of training programs for disaster medical coordinators and the development of disaster-time pediatric and perinatal liaisons. To enhance medical safety, JAOG launched an incidental case reporting system in 2004. Additionally, in 2010, a maternal mortality reporting system was introduced, followed by the maternal severe complications reporting system in 2021. The Japan Council for Implementation of Maternal Emergency Life-Saving System was established, along with the Japan Association for Labor Analgesia, a collaborative council for academic societies and organizations related to painless delivery. Suicide as a significant cause of maternal death led to the establishment of the \"Mother and Child Mental Forum\" academic conference, which later evolved into the Mental Health Care for Mother & Child training program. In the field of prenatal testing, non-invasive prenatal testing was introduced as a clinical research initiative. From 2020 onward: The year 2020 began with the global outbreak of COVID-19. Until 2023, numerous issues arose due to repeated pandemics, including delivery methods and locations for COVID-positive pregnant women, standard precautions during labor, mother-infant separation after birth, vaccination, so on. JSOG and JAOG worked together to address these challenges. The most pressing issue in the perinatal field is the declining birth rate. Alongside an aging workforce of physicians and a shortage of successors, the decrease in new obstetric clinic openings has become a major concern. By 2024, the decrease in the number of full-time obstetricians and the overtime work limits in Medical Care Act are making it necessary to reconsider the structure of obstetric medical services. Japan's perinatal care system, which has maintained the highest global standards, now stands at a major crossroads. Researchers (clinicians), academic societies, and professional organizations, centered on the mother and child, have collaborated with support from the government, making progress and building the current safe pregnancy and childbirth management system. However, significant issues remain that need urgent attention, including regulations on overtime work, securing obstetrician numbers, the rapid decline in childbirth facilities, and the functional collapse of perinatal maternal-child healthcare centers. These are critical challenges that must be addressed promptly.",

We sought to examine the available evidence on interventions to reduce ethnic health inequalities in maternal, neonatal and infant outcomes during pregnancy and up to the first year of the postnatal period. We conducted a systematic review searching MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science (Social Science Index) databases, <i>Journal of Health Visiting</i>, Google Scholar and grey literature from relevant websites (from inception up to 11 August 2023). Interventions were mapped to a priori conceptual framework consisting of six levels (patient, provider, microsystem, organisation, community and policy). The 'template for intervention description and replication' checklist was used for intervention description. Results across studies were narratively synthesised and reported following the 'synthesis without meta-analysis' guidelines. The electronic search identified 11 600 studies, with 16 studies describing eight types of interventions meeting the inclusion criteria. Studies were published between 1981 and 2022, predominantly in England (n=14), with a range of outcomes reported, including mode of delivery, place of birth, birth weight, stillbirth and preterm birth. The sample size varied from 21 to 20 651 participants with ethnic minority populations ranging from 18.9% to 100% of the study population. Studies mapped mainly to the patient level with policy least represented (14 and two, respectively). All studies described the reasons for the intervention with limited reporting on any modification during the study (n=2). Two studies with two types of interventions (early pre-eclampsia screening and midwifery continuity of care) demonstrated the potential for interventions to reduce ethnic health inequalities. This review highlights the paucity of evaluated interventions to tackle ethnic health inequalities in maternal, neonatal/infant outcomes. Mapping interventions to the conceptual framework provides the evidence base for national policy interventions to tackle these long-protracted inequities. CRD42023453083.",

        "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BLCA) is an aggressive malignancy characterized by high rate of recurrence. Its steadily increasing incidence and prevalence have made it one of the most prevalent urogenital tract tumors worldwide. Although immunotherapy serves as a first-line treatment for BLCA, patient prognosis shows significant heterogeneity. Risk stratification through immunotherapy risk scoring could substantially improve prognostic predictions. However, current studies examining the use of immune treatment risk scores to predict the prognosis of immunotherapy across various patients with BLCA remain in its early stages. This research aims to identify immune-related genes as potential biomarkers for BLCA immunotherapy guidelines. To fill this gap, we used two independent immunotherapy datasets from the \"IMvigor210CoreBiologies\" package as the training cohort and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database as the validation cohort to create a risk score signature based on deep learning algorithm to assess the effectiveness and outlook of BLCA immunotherapy. A risk score model comprising three immunotherapeutic-related genes was established and validated, demonstrating significant predictive power and serving as an independent factor for forecasting overall survival (OS) in BLCA immunotherapy. Furthermore, our model revealed a strong association with drug sensitivity responses and identified immune landscape differences among various BLCA patients. We anticipated that the risk score, which is an independent prognostic factor, would be taken into consideration when deciding whether to provide clinical immunotherapy for BLCA patients.",

        "title": "Sequelae of preterm birth over the lifespan: an exploratory analysis of behavioral problems in childhood and increased risk of major depression and anxiety in adulthood from a cohort study.",
        "abstract": "Existing research has shown that prematurity and low birth weight are associated with mental health in children and adolescents, but their impact on mental health in adulthood and the mechanisms involved have been less studied. This study investigated the impact of prematurity and abnormal fetal growth, as a marker for fetal growth restriction, on mental health outcomes in adulthood. This retrospective cohort study examined adults aged 18-52 years, categorized by gestational age (extremely preterm: ≤28 weeks; very preterm: 29-32 weeks; moderately preterm: 33-36 weeks; term: ≥37 weeks). The cohort consists of individuals who were either born preterm or at term from 1969 to 2002. Data collection occurred between 2019 and 2021. This exploratory analysis used multivariable logistic regression to assess the impact of prematurity and fetal growth restriction on adult mental health outcomes (measured by the \"Patient Health Questionnaire\"), adjusting for age, gender, and socioeconomic status. The study also explored the relationship between childhood behavioral problems, retrospectively described by the mothers of the participants (2-4 years), and adult mental health, with separate analyses for preterm and term births. The multivariable logistic regression analysis of 606 participants (average age 28·96 ± 8·9 years, 326 females) indicated that a low gestational age of ≤28 weeks was independently associated with an increased prevalence of major depressive disorder (OR = 4·14, CI: 1·43-11·77, p = 0·01) and anxiety disorder (OR = 5·17, CI: 1·51-17·37, p = 0·01) in adulthood compared to a gestational age of ≥37 weeks. A low birth weight percentile was not associated with mental disorders. Further regression analysis revealed that peer problems and emotional problems in childhood were significantly associated with major depression in adulthood in participants born preterm. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the previously observed association between the gestational age group of ≤28 weeks and major depressive disorder was no longer statistically significant (OR = 2·84, CI: 0·85-9·07, p = 0·08) when the model was adjusted for maternal smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The association between the extreme preterm group and generalized anxiety disorder remained significant (OR = 4·63, CI: 1·27-16·22, p = 0·02). This study provides exploratory insights into the complex impact of prematurity on mental health in adulthood, highlighting the vulnerability of the extremely preterm group (≤28 weeks) from a multi-informant, lifespan perspective. It emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring and psychosocial support for those born extremely preterm, from infancy through adulthood, to mitigate potential adverse mental health outcomes.

        "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in nursing practice holds promise for enhancing patient care but is hindered by significant challenges. This literature reviews synthesized research from 2015 to 2024, examining barriers nurses face in adopting AI technologies. A comprehensive search across multiple databases identified relevant articles, leading to the inclusion of 19 studies for thematic analysis. The analysis revealed nine key challenges: a lack of training and education, resistance to change, data privacy and security concerns, integration issues with existing systems, high costs, limited access to technology, and regulatory and ethical dilemmas. These interconnected obstacles collectively impact the effective integration of AI in nursing practice. Addressing these challenges is crucial for leveraging AI's full potential to improve patient outcomes. As organizations implement AI solutions, they must prioritize targeted training, infrastructure upgrades, and ethical guidelines to foster an adaptive and compliant nursing workforce. Proactively navigating these barriers is essential for optimizing AI integration in nursing, ultimately enhancing the quality of care and operational efficiency. The integration of AI in nursing practice necessitates enhanced training and education to equip nurses with the skills needed for effective use, fostering a culture of adaptability to technological advancements. Additionally, healthcare policies must prioritize investments in robust cybersecurity and clear regulatory frameworks to ensure ethical AI implementation while safeguarding patient data and enhancing care delivery.",

        "abstract": "Ciprofol, an innovative anesthetic derived from propofol, has not yet been studied in detail regarding its effects in colorectal cancer (CRC). This study mainly explored the effects of Ciprofol on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, glycolysis, and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in CRC cells. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we successfully demonstrated that Ciprofol can inhibit the proliferative capacity of CRC cells and tissues. It can also suppress the invasion, metastasis, and EMT process of CRC cells. In addition, treatment with Ciprofol decreased the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in CRC cells, thereby inhibiting cellular glycolysis. However, knockdown of APC could reverse the effects of Ciprofol. Regarding the mechanism, overexpression of APC was able to activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Ciprofol could activate the expression of APC, subsequently activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The addition of Derivative83 could reverse Ciprofol - mediated regulation of this pathway. This study still has certain limitations. For example, the verification through clinical trials, as well as issues such as the safety and efficacy of ciprofol, remain the key focuses of future research.",

        "abstract": "Given the significant role of the gut microbiota in early immune and metabolic development, the impact of perinatal antibiotic administration on the neonatal gut microbiome remains a crucial area of investigation. This study examines how maternal and neonatal antibiotic exposure affects the composition of the gut microbiome in preterm infants. A prospective controlled cohort study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital from January 2021 to September 2023. The study enrolled neonates with a gestational age of less than 37 weeks. Preterm infants were categorized into four groups based on exposure to maternal or neonatal antibiotics: the NE group (no exposure), IE group (infant exposure only), ME group (maternal exposure only), and IME group (both infant and maternal exposure). In the NE group, \"No exposure\" refers to participants whose mothers did not receive intrapartum antibiotics or whose neonates were not administered postnatal antibiotics prior to sample collection. Data on antibiotic use and microbiota composition from stool samples were collected and analyzed via the convection culture method. This study included 182 preterm infants, yielding 364 stool samples. By day 4, the prevalence of Klebsiella pneumoniae increased significantly, reaching 70% in the IE group compared with 42.6% in the NE group (p < 0.001). Bifidobacterium spp. was more prevalent in the NE group than in the other groups on day 4 (57.4%, p = 0.019). The antibiotic-exposed groups (IE, ME, and IME groups) presented greater abundances of potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, whereas beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium spp., were more abundant in the NE group. These findings suggest that perinatal antibiotic exposure is associated with significant changes in the neonatal gut microbiota, potentially increasing the pathogenic microbiota. The study was registered with the Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI) under the number CTRI/2020/11/029375 | http://ctri.nic.in/ on November 19, 2020.",

        "abstract": "Twin pregnancies carry a 2-3 times higher risk of hypertensive disorders compared to singleton pregnancies. Despite this, clinical guidelines do not differentiate between the two. Compare the onset, progression, and incidence of preeclampsia (PET) in twin versus singleton pregnancies, both antepartum and postpartum. This retrospective single-center cohort study analyzed maternal and neonatal outcomes related to hypertension (HTN) in twin and singleton pregnancies from January 2008 to July 2021. Patients with pre-existing chronic HTN, kidney disease, or intrauterine fetal demise were excluded. Primary outcome was the gestational age at the diagnosis of severe PET. Secondary outcomes included rates of mild and severe HTN-related complications, gestational age and mean blood pressure at diagnosis, incidence of eclampsia, antihypertensive treatment requirements, and maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes. A total of 403 twin and 3096 singleton pregnancies were included. Severe PET rates were significantly higher in twin pregnancies compared to singletons (34.0 % vs. 19.3 %, p < 0.001). Both mild and severe PET presented significantly earlier in twin pregnancies (35.7 ± 2.1 vs. 38.1 ± 2.6 weeks, p < 0.001; and 35.5 ± 2.3 vs. 37.5 ± 3.1 weeks, p < 0.001, respectively). Twin pregnancies also demonstrated increased antihypertensive treatment use and required multiple medications more frequently. Preeclampsia in twin pregnancies develops earlier and presents more severely compared to singleton pregnancies. These findings highlight distinct clinical courses, underscoring the need for tailored management strategies. Enhanced monitoring and more aggressive interventions, including earlier delivery, may improve outcomes in twin pregnancies.",

        "abstract": "Eclampsia is traditionally considered a complication of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). However, atypical cases occur without preceding HDP, and their pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to compare the clinical features of eclampsia with and without prior HDP diagnosis. We retrospectively analyzed 31 singleton pregnancies with eclampsia diagnosed at nine Japanese perinatal centers between 2007 and 2023. Cases were classified into two groups: eclampsia preceded by HDP (n = 14) and eclampsia not preceded by HDP (n = 17). Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and perinatal outcomes were compared. Of the 31 cases of eclampsia, 17 (57%) were not preceded by HDP, while the remaining cases had been diagnosed with HDP prior to the onset of eclampsia. In the eclampsia not preceded by HDP group, compared to the eclampsia preceded by HDP group, the BMI was significantly lower (22.07 ± 2.05 vs. 25.60 ± 6.19 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, P = 0.047), the gestational week at delivery was significantly later (median 40.0 [32.0-41.0] vs. 37.5 [26.0-41.0] weeks, P = 0.020), and the proportion of male neonates was significantly higher (58.8% vs. 14.3%, P = 0.024). When comparing the onset periods-antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum-the eclampsia not preceded by HDP group exhibited the highest number of cases during the intrapartum period, with 9 cases, while the eclampsia preceded by HDP group showed the highest number during the postpartum period, with 8 cases. Furthermore, in the eclampsia not preceded by HDP group, the white blood cell count was significantly higher immediately after onset (20,626 ± 7,956 vs. 14,687 ± 5,664 /μL, P = 0.039). Atypical eclampsia without preceding HDP shows distinct clinical features, including later gestational age at onset, higher intrapartum incidence, and elevated inflammatory markers. These findings suggest a need for further investigation into alternative pathophysiological mechanisms and tailored clinical strategies for such cases.",

Few research projects have focused on the implementation aspect. This study observed and supported the process for implementation of a new MU in Italy using participatory action research (PAR) and codesign. A 4-stage project was conducted to codesign an implementation plan aimed at supporting the transition from the obstetrically led maternity unit to an integrated model with a MU. The study engaged maternity professionals, managers and service users via online focus groups and eSurveys. Participants identified ten themes to focus the implementation work on: team vision, creation of a multidisciplinary advisory group, creation of a dedicated group of midwives, implementation of intrapartum guidelines for low-risk women, appropriate risk assessment, integration hospital-community, training, effective communication and information for service users and within the team, and reflective practice. Service users supported the initiatives proposed in the implementation plan and expressed openness towards the model of care and its implementation. This was the first study using codesign and PAR including maternity team, managers and service users to support the implementation of a MU.

Potential predictors were collected at enrollment or were measured during the year of the study. We performed a two-stage risk factor analysis, using univariate regression modeling to identify potential risk factors, followed by multivariable regression modeling to identify independent, significant risk factors for smaller OFC at birth and 1 year in this low resource setting. Mean OFC at enrollment was -0.4 (1.2) and at 1 year was -1.1 (0.9). Probable zika exposure in utero and shorter maternal height were independently, significantly associated with smaller OFC at both enrollment and 1 year. Exposure to cigarette smoking in utero was independently significantly associated with smaller OFC at enrollment. Infant complications at birth, microcephaly at enrollment and stunting at enrollment were also independently significantly associated with smaller OFC at 1 year (all p-values < 0.05). No exposures measured during the study were associated with OFC at 1 year. All the independent predictors of small OFC during the study period were present at enrollment (within the first 3 months of life), including maternal height, and smoking and ZIKV exposure during pregnancy. Exposures after the first three months of life were not predictive of OFC at one year. Continued work to identify specific risk factors and develop targeted prevention programs is warranted.",

This systematic review evaluates the relationship between inflammatory cytokines and depressive symptoms in postpartum women. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a search was conducted across five electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Tripdatabase) up to September 2024. Studies examining the relationship between inflammatory cytokines and postpartum depressive symptoms that were published in English were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the Revised Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions 2. Nine studies were included in this review. A total of 888 postpartum women were analysed across nine studies. IL-1β was significantly elevated in postpartum women with depressive symptoms in two studies. IL-6 showed mixed findings, with three studies supporting an association, while three others did not. IL-10 and TNF-α generally showed no significant relationship with depressive symptoms. The overall quality of the studies included varied, with three studies at high risk of bias and five at low risk. Evidence on the relationship between inflammatory cytokines and postpartum depressive symptoms is inconsistent. IL-1β may be linked to depressive symptoms. TNF-α and CRP may have no relationship with depressive symptoms in postpartum women, but the roles of IL-6 and IL-10 remain unclear. More high-quality research is necessary to determine the clinical significance of cytokine levels in predicting or managing postpartum depression.",

This study aims to assess the implementation, effectiveness, and sustainability of a breast cancer screening program in China to provide insights into developing an effective implementation strategy suitable for rural areas with limited health resources. This study employed the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to assess the implementation, effectiveness, and sustainability of a breast cancer screening program in Ordos, Inner Mongolia, China. An explanatory mixed methods design was applied, in which qualitative data were used to explain unexpected quantitative findings. The quantitative study, conducted from 2016 to 2020, analyzed screening records and survey data from 177,107 women aged 35-64. The qualitative study, conducted in 2024, collected data through semi-structured interviews with nine health workers and analyzed the transcripts using thematic analysis. The qualitative themes and quantitative findings were matched within the RE-AIM framework. The screening program covered 52.24% of the women by the end of 2020, with a total of 177,107 women receiving screening. The cancer detection rate was 0.56/1000, ranging from 0.09/1000 in women aged 35-39 to 1.58/1000 in those aged 60-64. The Positive Prediction Value (PPV) for biopsy was over 64.9%, but few patients who were referred for further examinations (mammography and biopsy) completed the procedure. Key facilitators included strong patient-provider communication, staff involvement, adequate funding and training, and strict supervision, while barriers involved geographical distance, lack of multi-sector support, limited service capacity, and low health awareness. The \"rural outreach\" model (where MCHHs conduct screenings by visiting rural villages and setting up temporary clinics at local village health centers), along with routine hospital screening, was seen as the most effective solution for reaching dispersed populations with low health awareness and literacy. Increased awareness from prior screenings improved participation and compliance in subsequent programs. A key challenge in program maintenance was the reduction in quality control, supervision, and training efforts. To improve cancer detection in rural areas, it is essential to strengthen both the screening capacity of primary healthcare facilities and the patient referral system for timely diagnosis. \"Rural outreach\" is an effective way to reduce health inequity in marginalized women and increase their awareness at the same time. Further research is needed to assess long-term outcomes and develop customized implementation strategies for overcoming the identified barriers.",

However, there is a limited understanding of peripartum SSRI impacts on maternal neurobehavioral responses, and particularly those of sertraline, the most prescribed SSRI in United States (US) pregnancies. We administered C57Bl/6 females sertraline via a non-invasive, naturalistic approach (167 mg/L drinking water) from 2 weeks pre-conception through lactation (PND21) or for an equivalent duration in nonpregnant controls. We assessed behavior and molecular brain changes intrapartum and postpartum at ~1 year of age. Chronic sertraline reduced depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. Pregnancy itself decreased anxiety-like and hedonic behaviors. RNA sequencing of maternal brain revealed only 52 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in frontal cortex with sertraline. These DEGs over-represented functions related to immunity. In contrast, sertraline altered 962 targets in maternal hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, with DEGs overrepresenting neurotransmission and neurodegeneration. We then discontinued sertraline and aged animals to approximately 1 year to test neurodegenerative phenotypes. Having one prior litter, regardless of peripartum sertraline, improved aged females' spatial learning and memory. Sertraline, regardless of postpartum status, improved working memory. Further, we found buffering of neurodegeneration-related gene network changes and increased excitatory synapse density in the hippocampus after peripartum sertraline. Peripartum sertraline alters maternal neurobiology and behavior in pregnancy and beyond, with long-term benefits to neurodegenerative processes. Pregnancy also exerts its own, lasting effects on learning and memory. These findings might be exploited in the future to abrogate neurodegenerative disease.",

In this study, we assessed cognitive and emotional behaviors in lactating C57BL/6 J dams subjected to different PS from postnatal day 1 to day 21, along with chronic restraint stress (CRS). Subsequently, hippocampal samples were collected to analyze the expression of NLRP3, IL-18, and IL-1β, along with microglial activation and adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We further modulated AHN using viral and examined the effects of AHN overexpression or inhibition on behavior and hippocampal neuroinflammation. Dams subjected to brief PS exhibited reduced anxiety and depressive-like behaviors and improved cognitive function. Additionally, PS15 dams showed decreased hippocampal expression of NLRP3, IL-18, and IL-1β, reduced microglia activation, and increased AHN. Overexpression of AHN can significantly improved cognitive function, but no significant changes in emotional behaviors were observed. Besides, AHN-mediated cognitive behavior participates in resilience to anxiety and depression-like behaviors of dams after CRS. Similarly, inhibition of hippocampal NLRP3 expression enhanced AHN-related cognitive behavior and promoted stress resilience in adult female mice. Brief PS resulted in resilience to anxiety and depressive-like behaviors in dams and mitigated memory impairments induced by CRS. This study confirmed AHN-mediated cognitive behavior participates in stress resilience to anxiety and depression-like behaviors in postpartum dams after CRS.",

This cross-sectional study collected demographic data and KAP scores from family members of children with M. pneumoniae infection at the People's Hospital of Dongxihu, Wuhan, from March to July 2024. A total of 521 family members participated in this study. The average age of family members was 37.65 ± 7.27 years, and the average age of children was 6.60 ± 3.64 years. The average scores were 8.88 ± 4.52 for knowledge (possible range: 0-20), 33.07 ± 3.72 for attitude (possible range: 8-40), and 35.22 ± 4.28 for practice (possible range: 8-40). Positive correlations were observed among the KAP dimensions, with knowledge showing a strong correlation with both attitude (r = 0.189, P < 0.001) and practice (r = 0.569, P < 0.001). The structural equation model demonstrated that knowledge had a total effect on both attitude (β = 0.415, 95%CI 0.327-0.501, P = 0.009) and practice (β = 0.430, 95%CI 0.353-0.502, P = 0.007). Additionally, the attitude had a direct effect on practice (β = 0.680, 95%CI 0.567-0.747, P = 0.020). The indirect effect of knowledge on practice through attitude was also significant (β = 0.282, 95%CI 0.227-0.351, P = 0.007). Family members showed positive attitudes but lacked knowledge about M. pneumoniae infection, highlighting the need for targeted educational efforts. The results imply that improving knowledge about M. pneumoniae infection should also improve attitude and practice, possibly resulting in better patient outcomes.",

Secondary analysis of data from the Korea Nurses' Health Study, a nationwide prospective cohort study. Online surveys distributed from 2014 to 2023 in Korea. Nurses (N = 296) who gave birth in the past year. We categorized GWG using guidelines from the Institute of Medicine and conducted bivariate and logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with inadequate and excessive GWG. Among participants, 40.2% had inadequate GWG, 36.1% had adequate GWG, and 23.7% had excessive GWG. We found significant differences in GWG based on pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and weekly overtime hours worked. As age increased, the odds of excessive GWG decreased (odds ratio (OR) = 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.79, 0.99]), whereas higher levels of fatigue were associated with increased odds (OR = 1.08, 95% CI [1.01, 1.15]) of excessive GWC. Our study suggests that health care providers should consider ethnicity, pre-pregnancy BMI, overtime work hours, age, and fatigue levels when educating and caring for pregnant nurses. Although the findings reflect a specific maternal population of Korean nurses, they may inform care for similar working women. We recommend that information about GWG be incorporated into prenatal education, visits, checklists, and counseling for women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.",

Effective management relies on multispecialty collaboration and consensus, supported by standardized protocols, to optimize outcomes, guide informed clinical decisions, and mitigate the risks associated with PAS. To examine clinical practice guidelines for PAS inclusive of high-income countries and low- to middle-income countries (LMICs) identifying areas of consensus and gaps in guidance. A comprehensive search of PubMed, GIN Library, and ECRI Guidelines Trust identified all PAS-related clinical practice guidelines published from January 1, 2014, to January 31, 2024. Additional searches included professional societies' designated websites and cited references. Two independent reviewers screened the guidelines, resolving conflicts through cross-referencing. Initially, 2 independent reviewers provided structured review and feedback to refine, correct, or highlight areas of consensus, disagreement, or insufficient evidence. Any instances of nonagreement were adjudicated by majority panel agreement, arising from a panel of 15 to 18 experts, all authors of PAS guidelines. Agreement scores for each recommendation area (eg, epidemiology, diagnosis, and antenatal management) were categorized as high agreement (≥75%), poor consensus (<50% or ≥30% insufficient evidence), and high levels of insufficient evidence (≥50% of recommendations with insufficient evidence) based on a priori score criteria. A total of 14 guidelines from 18 articles from national and international societies were included. High agreement was noted in areas such as specialized expertise (100%), antenatal management (88.9%), diagnosis (76.9%), and epidemiology (75.0%). Poor consensus characterized cesarean hysterectomy management (38.5% insufficient evidence and 23.0% disagreement), conservative techniques (33.3% insufficient evidence and 11.1% disagreement), and fertility counseling (30.0% insufficient evidence and 10.0% disagreement). Despite the high risk of anemia, consensus was lacking on iron supplementation strategies. Recommendations for thromboembolism prevention varied, with some guidelines favoring pharmacologic interventions and others advocating for nonpharmacologic measures. Hemorrhage management and postnatal management recommendations, including iron supplementation and thromboembolism prevention, were characterized by high levels of insufficient evidence (55.6% and 57.1%, respectively). Only 1 article (5.6%) specifically addressed LMICs, highlighting substantial underrepresentation. This systematic review of PAS guidelines identified significant discrepancies and insufficient evidence in key aspects of care. The findings underscore the urgent need for further research and quality measures to enhance standardized approaches and improve patient outcomes. The limited availability of recommendations applicable to LMICs highlights the critical need for tailored guidance that accounts for resource constraints and clinical access challenges unique to these settings.",

To assess healthcare professionals' (HCPs) prescribing behaviors, comfort levels, and challenges when advising patients, focusing on discrepancies between clinical guidance documents and SmPC/PIL. Online survey entitled PRAISE (Perception of healthcare providers Regarding Antirheumatics in pregnancy and breastfeeding: advice, Information and patient perSpEctives) and disseminated through HCPs groups and social media. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 414 HCPs globally. Respondents were divided into prescribers (<i>n</i> = 336) and non-prescribers (<i>n</i> = 78) based on their self-reported role in prescribing antirheumatic medications to pregnant or breastfeeding patients with RMDs. The survey covered demographics, clinical experience, confidence in prescribing, use of clinical guidelines, and experiences managing conflicting information between guidelines and SmPC/PIL. Prescribers were more likely than non-prescribers to feel comfortable discussing medication safety during pregnancy. Most prescribers found clinical guidance documents useful, with 48% rating them as \"very useful\" and 38% as \"extremely useful.\" In case of conflicting information between clinical guidance documents and SmPC/PIL, 58% of HCPs reported that it caused confusion and tension in patient-doctor relationships, and almost 20% of them are \"likely\" or \"very likely\" to discontinue ongoing treatment. Clear communication and shared decision-making were the most common strategies used to address patient concerns. HCPs often face significant challenges when advising patients with RMDs on the use of medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Conflicting information between clinical guidance documents and SmPC/PIL can disrupt patient-doctor relationship and lead to treatment discontinuation, with potential consequences on maternal disease control. Improved alignment between clinical guidance documents and the SmPC/PIL could enhance patient care and prevent confusion among HCPs and patients.",

        "abstract": "Antenatal care (ANC) is crucial for maternal and neonatal health, facilitating early complication management, health education, and promoting skilled birth assistance. Despite global ANC recommendations, implementation remains suboptimal in sub-Saharan Africa, where maternal and neonatal mortality rates remain high. Assessing ANC prevalence and its determinants can help address gaps and improve health outcomes. This study utilised data from recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between 2015 and 2022 across SSA countries, using a weighted sample of 196,459 women. ANC service use during pregnancy was classified as no ANC visits, one to three ANC visits, or four or more visits. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate explanatory variable effects, reported as relative risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Among participants, 11.2% received no ANC, 30.5% had one to three visits, and 58.4% attended four or more visits. ANC utilisation varied by region, with 54.7% of women in East Africa and 60.3% in West Africa receiving four or more visits. Having health insurance showed one of the strongest positive associations with ANC attendance for both one to three visits (RRR = 2.81, 95% CI: 2.37, 3.34; p < 0.001) and four or more visits (RRR = 2.95, 95% CI: 2.48, 3.51; p < 0.001). Women who did not consider obtaining permission to visit a health facility as a problem also had a higher likelihood of attending one-three visits (RRR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.53, 1.81; p < 0.001) or ≥ four visits (RRR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.77, 2.09; p < 0.001). Higher maternal education, longer preceding birth intervals, and an improved wealth index were significantly associated with a greater probability of attending ≥ four ANC visits (p < 0.001). In contrast, living in a rural area was associated with lower odds of attending ≥ four visits (RRR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.58, 0.72; p < 0.001). This study highlights disparities in ANC utilisation in SSA, with many women receiving insufficient or no ANC visits. Individual, household, and community-level factors, such as education, health insurance, income, geographic access, and others, strongly influence ANC service use. Strengthening maternal health insurance schemes can alleviate financial barriers, and community-based outreach programs and educational campaigns can enhance access and awareness, and improve access and continuity of care, particularly in rural or remote areas. Integrating these strategies into broader health policies and fostering collaboration between healthcare providers, policymakers, and local communities allows for narrowing existing gaps in ANC utilisation and ultimately improving maternal and neonatal outcomes across the region.",

To evaluate which characteristics in the USPSTF guidelines identify risk status and the association of preeclampsia risk with AP recommendations. This observational cohort study enrolled from July 2020 to March 2023 with data analysis performed from October to December 2024. Enrollment occurred at 11 centers throughout the US or via direct-to-participant recruitment. Pregnant participants aged 18 years or older with a singleton pregnancy less than 22 weeks' gestation were selected via convenience sampling. The exposures were clinical factors abstracted from medical records by research coordinators, which were stratified according to USPSTF definitions of low, moderate (parity, advanced maternal age [AMA], race, and body mass index), and high (chronic hypertension, prior preeclampsia, type 1 or 2 diabetes, kidney disease, and/or autoimmune conditions) risk. Data collected included AP recommendation, presence of USPSTF-defined moderate risk factors or high risk factors, and any preeclampsia diagnosis. Effect sizes and relative risk (RR) were calculated within risk strata. Of 5684 participants (median [IQR] age, 30.9 [26.4-34.6] years; 267 [4.1%] Asian; 1191 [21.0%] Black; 990 Hispanic [17.4%]; 2764 [48.6%] White; and 472 [8.3%] with other race or ethnicity), 5046 (88.8%) were at increased risk of preeclampsia (3996 [70.3%] at moderate risk and 1050 [18.5%] at high risk). A total of 2438 participants (43.1%) received an AP recommendation. The overall preeclampsia rate was 12.1% (685 participants). The PE rates specific to USPSTF categories were 3.0% for those at low risk (19 of 638 participants), 10.5% for those at moderate risk (419 of 3996 patients), and 23.5% for those at high risk (247 of 1050 participants). Among individuals with 2 or more moderate risk factors but without any high risk factor, nulliparity was associated with significantly increased risk of preeclampsia (RR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.35-1.62; P < .001), while AMA was associated with decreased risk (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.96; P = .02); there was no association with obesity (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.22; P = .048) or Black race (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.80-1.14; P = .63). Of 1044 participants with any high risk factors, 856 (82.0%) were recommended AP and of 634 at low risk, 538 (85.9%) were not recommended AP. In contrast, of 1942 participants with 1 moderate risk factor, 463 (23.8%) were recommended AP, and of 2032 with 2 or more moderate risk factors, 1024 (50.4%) were recommended AP. In this prospective cohort study of 5684 singleton pregnancies, 89% of the population was assessed as having increased risk (moderate or high) of preeclampsia by USPSTF criteria. These findings suggest that moderate risk factors in the absence of high risk factors show no or low value for estimating the risk of developing preeclampsia, leading to nonspecific recommendations of AP in the moderate risk category.",

An intersectional perspective was employed for the analysis. The literature search included databases such as PubMed and Scielo, covering studies from 2000 to 2024. Eligibility criteria included empirical studies in Spanish, English, or Portuguese. Five researchers evaluated and extracted data. The information was organized in tables and figures. A total of 53 studies were selected out of 556, based on inclusion criteria related to gender, substance use, and regional context. Brazil and Mexico led the academic production, with most studies published between 2004 and 2024, primarily using quantitative descriptive methods. The studies are grouped into 5 themes: prevalence, sociocultural aspects, violence and risks, vulnerable groups, and interventions and treatments. Alcohol and tobacco use were the most studied, followed by marijuana, cocaine, and crack. However, polydrug use and recreational consumption were less explored, as were the experiences of transgender and gender-diverse individuals. Only 4 studies applied an intersectional approach, while most analyses were limited to binary gender perspectives. PS use among women reflects complex inequalities tied to gender, race, and class, amplified by structural violence and socioeconomic barriers. Strengthening regional collaboration, adopting intersectional approaches, and diversifying study populations are essential for designing inclusive and effective interventions. Research must overcome current gaps and address underexplored topics like recreational consumption and gender-diverse experiences.",

A case-control study was conducted at the Hospital Regional do Sudoeste Walter Alberto Pecóits in Francisco Beltrão (PR), between December 2023 and September 2024. Among the 1,400 births that occurred in the hospital's delivery room between December 1, 2023, and the end of September 2024, 37 newborns (2.6%) with congenital anomalies were identified during the study period. A total of 37 case mothers and 120 controls were included (a ratio of approximately 1:3). The sociodemographic variables included maternal age, residence, marital status, race, education level, family income, and maternal occupation. The behavioral variables considered smoking, alcohol consumption, and the use of drugs or medications during pregnancy. The fetal variables included the number of pregnancies, gestational age, type of delivery, miscarriage, Apgar score, birth weight, sex, fetal status, congenital anomalies, and the number of prenatal visits, with a minimum of six (one in the first trimester, two in the second, and three in the third), following the Ministry of Health guidelines. Among 1,400 live births, 37 cases of congenital anomalies were identified (2.6%, 95% CI: 1.80-3.48), while the control group included 120 women with newborns without congenital anomalies. Among cases, isolated anomalies were most common (62.2%), predominantly affecting the cardiovascular system (27.0%), followed by recognized syndromes (21.6%) and multiple malformations (16.2%). Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and medical record reviews. Bivariate analysis revealed significant associations between congenital anomalies and a family history of congenital anomalies (p = 0.02), low apgar scores at the 1st and 5th minutes (p < 0.01), and fetal status at birth (p < 0.01). Model 1, which integrates family history of congenital anomalies, apgar score at the 5th minute, and fetal status, showed the best predictive fit, consistent with previous findings. Bayesian logistic regression highlighted this model with the lowest AIC (295.98) and BIC (326.22) values, achieving 89% predictive accuracy. These results reinforce the importance of family history and neonatal vitality in the context of congenital anomalies, indicating the need for future studies to confirm these findings and improve prevention strategies.",

The study aims to examine adherence to the DLGP and investigate its association with postpartum weight retention at 6 months (PPWR6). This study is based on the Mother and Infant Nutrition Assessment prospective cohort study conducted among pregnant women in Lebanon (n = 152). Pregnant women were recruited during their first trimester and were followed up until 6 months after delivery. Data on the socio-economic, anthropometric and lifestyle characteristics of participants were collected. A validated FFQ was used to examine dietary intake during the second trimester. A composite score was calculated for the adherence to the DLGP, with high adherence defined as belonging to the third tertile of the score. PPWR6 was calculated as the difference between pre-pregnancy weight and weight at 6 months postpartum, and high PPWR6 was defined as belonging to the third tertile of PPWR6 (≥ 5.4 kg). Multiple logistic regression was used to examine associations between adherence to guidelines and PPWR6. The proportion of participants adhering was lowest for guidelines regarding saturated fats (1.3%), sugar (13.8%), hydration (21.7%), adequate gestational weight gain (37.5%), omega-3 supplementation (38.8%) and salt (44.1%). Average PPWR6 was 3.9 kg, with 34.2% of participants retaining ≥ 5 kg. While no association was observed between any of the individual guidelines with PPWR6, participants with high adherence to the DLGP had 77% lower odds of a PPWR6 more than 5.4 kg, compared to those in the first and second tertiles (adjusted OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.58). The findings of this study highlighted important gaps in adherence to the DLGP, along with a direct association between higher DLGP adherence and lower PPWR.

This study aimed to develop and test a theory to explain the role of internalized and experienced poverty stigma in the relationship between food security and mental health among mothers in the Southern US. A cross-sectional survey was administered in December 2023. The survey was delivered electronically via Qualtrics to mothers living in the southern US who reported a household income below 185% of the federal poverty level. Food security, stigma, and symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using previously validated tools. A path analysis was conducted based on the initial conceptual framework and adapted to remove nonsignificant variables. Linear regression was used to assess stigma by resource utilization. Mean poverty stigma scores among mothers (n = 1,008) were moderate for internalized (3.1 ± 0.8) and experienced stigma (3.1 ± 1.1). Lower food security was associated with higher internalized (β = 0.10, p < 0.001) and experienced stigma (β = 0.34, p < 0.001). Experienced stigma had a small association with both anxiety and depressive symptoms (β = 0.20, 0.23, p < 0.001). Participation in food pantries (+ 0.17) and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program (+ 0.45) was associated with higher experienced stigma (p < 0.05).

        "abstract": "Preeclampsia is a complex, multisystem obstetric disorder characterized by heterogeneous clinical manifestations, often requiring enhanced strategies for early detection, management, and risk stratification. This study aimed to evaluate potential alterations in non-invasive transcutaneous bilirubin levels measured at various maternal body sites in pregnant women diagnosed with preeclampsia. A total of 86 pregnant women who delivered at our institution were enrolled and classified into three groups: healthy pregnant women (Group 1, n = 30), women with preeclampsia (Group 2, n = 30), and women with pre-eclampsia with severe features (Group 3, n = 26). In addition to routine pre-delivery laboratory assessments, transcutaneous bilirubin levels were measured at two anatomical sites-the forehead and the abdominal skin overlying the uterine fundus-using a standard bilirubinometer. Each site was measured three times, and the mean of the three readings was recorded for analysis. Complete Blood Count and biochemical blood parameters of the women were evaluated. Relevant obstetric and demographic data were also collected and recorded. There were no statistically significant differences among the three groups in terms of maternal age, gravidity, parity, or body mass index (p > 0.05). Similarly, total serum bilirubin levels were comparable across the groups (Group 1: 0.45 mg/dL; Group 2: 0.39 mg/dL; Group 3: 0.44 mg/dL; p > 0.05). In contrast, transcutaneous bilirubin levels were significantly elevated in Group 3 compared to Groups 1 and 2. The mean transcutaneous bilirubin values for the forehead, uterine fundus, and overall (combined sites) were as follows: Group 1-3.07 ± 0.85, 2.35 ± 0.97, and 2.71 ± 0.76; Group 2-6.09 ± 1.94, 4.94 ± 1.64, and 5.52 ± 1.59; Group 3-7.12 ± 1.81, 6.12 ± 2.25, and 6.63 ± 1.69, respectively. All pairwise comparisons demonstrated statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). Transcutaneous bilirubin levels were significantly elevated in women with preeclampsia, particularly among those with severe disease. As a non-invasive, rapid, and cost-effective approach, TcB measurement may function as an adjunctive tool for the initial clinical assessment and risk stratification of preeclamptic patients.",

        "title": "COVID-19 Disruption and Maternal and Child Health Services: Evidence from India.",
        "abstract": "To analyze the impact of COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns on maternal and child health services in India and investigate whether certain population groups that are disadvantaged along social, economic and geographical dimensions experienced differential impacts. Utilizing an unintended disruption in the fifth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS V) due to nationwide COVID-19 related lockdown, we create a sample of children and mothers who were 'exposed' to COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, and those who were not 'exposed'. We use multivariable regression to examine whether and to what extent antenatal care, pregnancy and post-pregnancy care of the 'exposed' mothers and children were adversely impacted as compared to those who were 'unexposed'. The 'exposed' mothers were less likely to receive two tetanus injections, and iron folic acid tablets during pregnancy, and were less likely to stay in medical facility for 48 hours post-delivery as recommended by the government guidelines. More critically, 'exposed' children had lower probability of receiving immunizations due at birth, 6-weeks, 10-weeks, and 14-weeks, with the magnitude of decline increasing for successive immunizations. The impacts were even more adverse in rural areas as reflected in heterogeneity analysis. COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns adversely affected MCH services in India, and even more so in rural India. Policy interventions targeted specifically at groups who were impacted would be needed to restore MCH services to pre-pandemic levels. Not Applicable.",

        "title": "Quality faculty-nursing students' relationship: a systematic review of facilitators, barriers, and impact on students.",
        "abstract": "Faculty-student relationships are central to the academic and professional development of nursing students. This review aimed to systematically identify and synthesise existing evidence on the facilitators and barriers to quality faculty-nursing student relationships and their impact on student outcomes. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Comprehensive searches were carried out across major databases including PubMed Central, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, ERIC, JSTOR, Dimensions.ai, and others. Studies published in English between 2000 and 2025 that focused on faculty-nursing student relationships were included. The quality of the included studies was assessed using Joana Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools and mixed-method appraisal tool, and thematic synthesis was employed to analyse and report findings. Thirty-eight studies were included in the final synthesis. Key barriers identified included disrespectful behaviours, ineffective teaching, poor communication, institutional constraints, and discrimination. These factors contributed to psychological distress, disengagement, and reduced academic performance. Facilitators of positive relationships included strong faculty support, caring behaviours, respectful and inclusive interactions, effective communication, and structured learning environments. Positive relationships were associated with improved confidence, motivation, clinical readiness, and professional identity formation. Poor-quality relationships, in contrast, may be linked to emotional distress and negative perceptions of the nursing profession. Findings from the included studies suggest that the quality of the faculty-nursing student relationship plays a critical role in shaping student experiences and outcomes. Strengthening relational practices in nursing education may support student development and promote more inclusive and effective learning environments. Further research is needed to explore interventions across diverse settings. Not applicable.",

        "abstract": "To describe symptom patterns in first-time mothers through 3 months postpartum. Longitudinal, descriptive correlational. Secondary analysis of data from a randomised clinical trial of first-time mothers. Symptoms were assessed at 1, 2 and 3 months postpartum using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale for dimensions of 32 symptoms. New mothers (n = 114) reported an average of 7.0 (SD 4.7) symptoms at 1 month, decreasing to 5.3 (SD 4.3) at 3 months. Physical symptoms decreased to the greatest degree. Symptoms reported by over 33% of participants included lack of energy, worrying, pain, difficulty sleeping or concentrating and feeling irritable, sad or drowsy. The most distressing were lack of energy, feeling irritable, pain, nervousness and hair loss. Symptoms did not differ by type of birth or infant feeding. Older mothers (≥ 35 years) had significantly more symptoms and distress than younger mothers. Most symptoms improved over time, yet some were still prevalent at 3 months. Symptoms not appraised as particularly distressing may still be of clinical concern for safety reasons. Frequent postpartum assessments and interventions are important, particularly for older mothers. In the first 3 months, postpartum symptoms not perceived as distressing may lead to adverse health outcomes. These symptoms may threaten maternal-infant welfare beyond the first 3 months postpartum. Older first-time mothers merit particular attention by clinicians. The authors complied with STROBE reporting guidelines. No patient or public contribution.",

        "abstract": "Physical activity guidance and support for pregnant and postpartum populations across the island of Ireland (Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland) could be strengthened to better reflect international progress in this area. While Northern Ireland can align with UK guidelines and benefit from initiatives established in mainland UK, the Republic of Ireland has yet to develop updated recommendations or equivalent programmes. Although many pregnant and postpartum individuals know the benefits of physical activity, a significant gap remains in the support they receive to engage in it. While research in this area is emerging in mainland UK, comparable evidence remains limited across the island of Ireland. This underscores the need for policy reforms to embed physical activity guidance into routine maternity care. Eight actionable steps are proposed to address these gaps, with a focus on supporting the timely publication of physical activity guidelines specific to the Republic of Ireland for pregnancy and following childbirth, introducing specialised roles, accredited training and governance structures. These measures aim to empower individuals and professionals, ensuring effective delivery of physical activity support during these critical life stages. By prioritising these changes, the island of Ireland can enhance health outcomes for pregnant and postpartum populations, fostering long-term benefits for maternal and child health.",
