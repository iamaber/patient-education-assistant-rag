        "title": "Association of women's empowerment with childhood immunisation coverage in South and Southeast Asia: meta-analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys data from 11 countries.",
        "abstract": "Child health and gender inequalities are significant global public health issues that demand immediate action, particularly in South and Southeast Asian (SSEA) countries where both challenges are prevalent. This study examines the association between women's empowerment and child vaccination coverage in 11 SSEA low- and middle-income countries. Using population-level cross-sectional data from Demographic and Health Surveys across 11 SSEA countries, we developed an Individual-Level Women's Empowerment Index (ILWEI) based on three dimensions of women's empowerment: decision-making autonomy, attitude towards intimate partner violence and social independence. A three-stage mixed-effect individual participant data meta-analysis was employed to assess the association between ILWEI and childhood immunisation coverage. In India, 81.28% of women reported participation in three to four decision-making areas, followed by 62.07% in Bangladesh. Full immunisation coverage ranged from 32.43% in Afghanistan to 63.30% in Bangladesh. The association between women's empowerment and vaccination coverage varied across South and Southeast Asia, with the strongest positive associations observed in Pakistan. However, mixed or negative associations were found in countries such as India and Timor-Leste. Our findings indicate that in several SSEA countries, including Pakistan, Cambodia, the Philippines and Afghanistan, higher levels of individual women's empowerment are positively associated with an increased likelihood of childhood immunisation coverage. However, in countries such as India, Myanmar and Timor-Leste, higher women's empowerment was associated with lower odds of childhood immunisation, highlighting potential contextual or systemic barriers that may hinder vaccination uptake. This underscores the critical role of women's empowerment in enhancing childhood vaccination intake while also emphasising the need for targeted interventions to address country-specific challenges. Coordinated, multifaceted strategies are essential to empower women and thereby support the immunisation of children across regions.",

        "abstract": "The advent of mucosal vaccines that target the primary entry points of many pathogens has revolutionized the field of immunology. Genetically modified lactic acid bacteria (gmLAB), which include genera such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, have emerged as promising vectors for delivering antigens to mucosal surfaces. These gram-positive, non-pathogenic microorganisms exhibit inherent probiotic properties, can survive through the gastrointestinal tract, and efficiently interact with the host immune system. Advances in genetic engineering have enabled the expression of a wide range of antigens in gmLAB that promote systemic and mucosal immunity. Studies have demonstrated that gmLAB-based mucosal vaccines can elicit both mucosal and systemic immune responses, providing protective immunity against specific pathogenic infections. In addition, gmLAB vectors offer good safety profiles, stability, and cost-effective production compared to traditional vaccine platforms. Recent studies demonstrated the potential of LAB vaccines in preventing infections caused by viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens and in immunotherapy for treating allergies and cancers. This review highlights the mechanisms underlying gmLAB-based mucosal vaccine delivery, current advancements, challenges, and prospects in recombinant mucosal vaccines.",

The outcome of Powassan virus infection is shaped by both viral factors and the host immune response. While this review aimed to examine the innate immune response, particularly toll-like receptor-mediated immune responses to Powassan virus, data specific to the immune response to Powassan virus remain scarce. Therefore, we focused on toll-like receptor responses to related flaviviruses to infer possible mechanisms of host response. Insights from both in vivo and in vitro studies are critical for guiding the development of effective therapeutic and preventive strategies. Currently, there are no clinically approved treatments or vaccines for Powassan virus, highlighting the urgent need for their development. We also highlight recent progress in POWV vaccine development, with an emphasis on the potential use of toll-like receptor agonists as adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity and improve vaccine efficacy.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> An effective vaccine against Nipah virus (NiV) is crucial due to its high fatality rate and recurrent outbreaks in South and Southeast Asia. Vaccine development is challenged by the lack of validated accessible neutralization assays, as virus culture requires BSL-4 facilities, restricting implementation in resource-limited settings. To address this, we standardized and validated a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay (PNA) for assessing NiV-neutralizing antibodies in BSL-2 laboratories. <b>Methods:</b> The NiV-PNA was validated following international regulatory standards, using a replication-defective recombinant Vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) backbone dependent pseudotyped virus. Assessments included sensitivity, specificity, dilutional linearity, relative accuracy, precision, and robustness. The assay was calibrated using the WHO International Standard for anti-NiV antibodies and characterized reference sera to ensure reliable performance. <b>Findings:</b> Preliminary evaluation of the developed NiV-PNA showed 100% sensitivity and specificity across 10 serum samples (5 positive, 5 negative), with a positive correlation to a calibrated reference assay (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.8461). Dilutional linearity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9940) and accuracy (98.18%) were confirmed across the analytical titer range of 11-1728 IU/mL. The assay also exhibited high precision, with intra-assay and intermediate precision geometric coefficients of variation of 6.66% and 15.63%, respectively. Robustness testing demonstrated minimal variation across different pseudotyped virus lots, incubation times, and cell counts. <b>Conclusions</b>: The validated NiV-PNA is a reproducible and scalable assay platform for quantifying NiV neutralizing antibodies, offering a safer alternative to virus culture. Its validation and integration into the CEPI Centralized Laboratory Network will enhance global capacity for vaccine evaluation and outbreak preparedness.",

This study characterized humoral and cellular immune responses following vaccination with HEV239 or natural HEV infection in healthy Bangladeshi women aged 16-39 years. Using dual IFNγ and IL-4 ELISpot assays, we found robust, predominantly Th1-mediated cellular responses at 30 days after the third vaccine dose, comparable to responses during acute infection. Longitudinal antibody assessments confirmed sustained antibody production, primarily against the E2 domain of genotypes 1 and 3, persisting up to two years post-vaccination. Despite limitations related to sample size and assay sensitivity, our findings underscore the immunogenic potential of HEV239 and support a broader use in HEV-endemic regions.",

        "abstract": "The study aimed to determine the factors associated with the common disease prevalence of Sonali chicken farms in different regions of Bangladesh. A total of 243 farms were randomly selected from four Bangladesh districts to collect retrospective data. The study found that the most prevalent diseases were Newcastle Disease (76.54%), Infectious Bursal Disease (51.44%), Avian Influenza (29.63%), Colibacillosis (22.63%), Coccidiosis (69.55%), Brooder Pneumonia (34.98%), and Ascariasis (20.16%). The secondary group of the education level of these farmers (84.9%), visitors allowance farm (81.9%), and farms in which dead birds are buried (91.3%) have significantly (P ≤ 0.05) higher prevalence of ND. The potential flock-level protective factors of ND prevalence were the visitors not allowed on the farm (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.28-0.92; P = 0.024) and dead chicken disposal by buried (OR = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.08-0.56; P = 0.000). Farmers who used deep wells (56.9%) and clean feeders and drinkers every 3 days (72.2%) have a higher prevalence (P ≤ 0.05) of IBD. The risk factor for IBD: the Sonali chicken farmers had no idea about vaccine transportation to maintain the temperature (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.01-3.13; P = 0.048). Rangpur district (44.8%), farms that used cefalexin (51.1%) on their farm during the brooding period, and the farms in which farmers have no idea of chick grade have a higher prevalence (P ≤ 0.05) of AI. The farm whose farmer bought the chicks from the hatchery (36.7%) had a noticeably (P ≤ 0.05) higher prevalence of colibacillosis. Mymensingh district (80.0%), male farmers' farms (74.7%), large-scale farms (87.5%), and farms in which wood shavings were used as litter (77.8%) have a higher prevalence (P ≤ 0.05) of coccidiosis. Rangpur district (49.2%), in farms where farmers were not practicing handwashing (41.5%), didn't maintain routine cleaning of feeders and drinkers (43.6%), and didn't use antibiotics during the brooding period (68.1%) had a higher prevalence of brooder pneumonia. Kishoreganj district (30.0%), male farmers (22.1%), farmers with primary education levels (30.7%), and Large-scale farms (2501-5200 birds) (25.1%), farms using wood shavings as litter material (35.6%), farms sourcing chicks from hatcheries (23.0%,) and farms that used florfenicol (30.8%) as an antibiotic during the brooding period had a significant (P ≤ 0.05) higher prevalence of Ascariasis. Poor biosecurity, improper waste management, inexperience with chick quality & antibiotics used, and missing regular vaccinations make farms more likely to experience disease outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "One of the leading causes of global child mortality continues to be diarrhoea where rotavirus contributed to about 24% of deaths among all diarrhoeal deaths, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries. Rotavirus vaccination programmes have contributed to the reduction of mortality from 24% to 19% in rotavirus infections among hospitalised children, but the burden of rotaviral diarrhoea remains high, especially in settings with undernutrition. We aimed to determine the association of rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology with prior vaccination, socioeconomic status and clinical factors in children to see their utility in clinical settings. We analysed secondary data from a multicentre clinical trial on antibiotic impact in children with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. We used stored stool samples of 6697 children aged 2-23 months old, presenting to a health facility with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. We determined rotavirus aetiology prevalence using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and looked at its association with the patient's rotaviral vaccination status, clinical symptoms and sociodemographic characteristics. Prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated with log-binomial regression models; if they did not converge, log-Poisson models were used. Rotavirus prevalence of 21.1% was observed. There was a weak and statistically non-significant inverse association between rotavirus vaccination and rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology (adjusted PR: 0.71, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.03). Of the five tested clinical symptoms, shorter diarrhoea duration was associated with rotaviral aetiology (PR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.29 to 5.45). Of the seven tested socioeconomic characteristics, only maternal and paternal secondary education compared with no formal education were associated with rotaviral aetiology (PR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.00, PR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.00 respectively). Rotaviral diarrhoea aetiology cannot accurately be determined with prior receipt of rotavirus vaccination among children presenting to facilities with diarrhoea and increased risk of mortality. Short diarrhoea duration and parental secondary education were associated with increased prevalence of rotaviral aetiology; however, their utility in clinical care remains unclear.",

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide, with 660,000 new cases and 350,000 deaths reported in 2022. This disease mainly affects women in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs), where 90% of cases occur. This study explored how LMICs are responding to the World Health Organization's (WHO) call to eliminate cervical cancer. It looked at cervical cancer rates, the use of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, and suggested strategies to fight the disease. The study analyzed the rates of cervical cancer and deaths in LMICs, the effectiveness of HPV vaccination programs, and how well screening efforts are working. To compare data across countries, it used age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) per 100,000 women per year. In 2022, the ASIR was 25.4% in lower income countries and 16.9% in lower-middle-income countries. The ASMR was also higher in lower income countries (18.5%) compared to lower-middle-income countries (10.3%). HPV vaccine coverage remains low in many LMICs, with significant differences between the rates of first and final doses completed. By 2050, the number of new cervical cancer cases is expected to rise. Although the WHO aims to eliminate cervical cancer by achieving 90% HPV vaccination by age 15, 70% screening coverage, and 90% access to treatment, many challenges remain in LMICs. These include weak healthcare systems, poor infrastructure, and a lack of health education. Overcoming these challenges through better vaccine distribution, improved screening programs, and stronger healthcare systems is essential to eliminate cervical cancer.",

This study therefore assessed three NiV vaccine candidates in pigs: (1) adjuvanted soluble NiV (s)G protein, (2) adjuvanted pre-fusion stabilised NiV (mcs)F protein, and (3) adenoviral vectored NiV G (ChAdOx1 NiV G). NiV sG induced the strongest neutralising antibody response, NiV mcsF induced antibodies best able to neutralise cell-cell fusion, whereas ChAdOx1 NiV G elicited CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. Despite differences in immunogenicity, prime-boost immunisation with all candidates conferred a high degree of protection against NiV infection.

Diarrhea prevalence was highest in high-risk zones (7.71 %), followed by moderate (5.98 %) and low-risk zones (4.67 %). Socioeconomic factors such as male gender, urban residence, extreme poverty, and lack of handwashing facilities were associated with a higher risk of diarrhea in high-risk zones, though this link was weaker in moderate and low-risk zones.

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) invasion from the gut lumen. Transmission between people occurs through ingestion of contaminated food and water, particularly in settings with poor water and sanitation infrastructure, resulting in over 10 million illnesses annually. As the pathogen invades via the gastrointestinal tract, it is plausible that the gut microbiome may influence the outcome of S. Typhi exposure. There is some evidence that bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may create an environment unfavourable to invasive Salmonella, but data from humans is limited. To investigate the association between the gut microbiome and typhoid fever, we analysed samples collected from three all-age cohorts enrolled in a prospective surveillance study conducted across three settings where typhoid fever is endemic (Dhaka, Bangladesh; Blantyre, Malawi; and Kathmandu, Nepal). Cohorts consisted of acute typhoid fever patients (n = 92), asymptomatic household contacts of typhoid fever patients (representing individuals who were likely exposed to S. Typhi but did not develop the disease, n = 97) and asymptomatic serosurvey participants with high Vi antibody titres (representing individuals who were exposed to S. Typhi and may be carriers, n = 69). The stool microbiomes of each cohort were characterised using shotgun metagenomics, and bacterial diversity, composition and function were compared. We identified 4 bacterial species that were significantly lower in abundance in typhoid fever patients compared with household contacts (i.e. probably exposed), in two of the three participant populations (Bangladesh and Malawi). These bacteria may represent taxa that provide protection against the development of clinical infection upon exposure to S. Typhi and include the inflammation-associated species Prevotella copri clade A and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Our functional analysis identified 28 specific metabolic gene clusters (MGCs) negatively associated with typhoid fever in Bangladesh and Malawi, including seven MGCs involved in SCFA metabolism. The putative protection provided by microbiome SCFA metabolism was supported by data from a controlled human infection model conducted in a UK population, in which participants who did not develop typhoid fever following ingestion of S. Typhi had a higher abundance of a putative SCFA-metabolising MGC (q-value = 0.22). This study identified the same protective associations between taxonomic and functional microbiota characteristics and non-susceptibility to typhoid fever across multiple human populations. Future research should explore the potential functional role of SCFAs and inflammation-associated bacteria in resistance to S. Typhi and other enteric infections. Video Abstract.",

We provide insight into ETEC epidemiology; we followed a population-based cohort in a vaccine trial. We analyzed data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial of an oral cholera vaccine conducted in an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study covers 90 geographical clusters with an average population of 2988 households/cluster (baseline population 268 896). Two cohort analyses were conducted, 1 as dynamic cohort that included all subjects at vaccination, in-migrants, and births over 4 years and a closed cohort, which included only individuals present at baseline. We evaluated individuals placed under treatment center-based diarrheal surveillance between 2011 and 2015. In the dynamic cohort, the ETEC incidence was 150/100 000 person-years (PY; 95% CI, 141-159), with seasonal peaks during warmer months, and in the closed cohort, the incidence was 153/100 000 PY (95% CI, 140, 166).

        "abstract": "The rapid development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines have been pivotal in the global battle against the pandemic. However, vaccine acceptance remains a critical determinant of their effectiveness. While numerous studies have explored factors influencing vaccine acceptance, there is a notable dearth of research regarding preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) among individuals with chronic diseases (ChD) who are at heightened risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. This study addresses this gap by investigating COVID-19 vaccine preferences and WTP among individuals with and without chronic diseases. Employing a discrete choice experiment (DCE) approach, we interviewed 843 participants to assess their preference for COVID-19 vaccine attributes such as origin, efficacy level, protection duration, and provider. We used a mixed logit model to analyze DCE data and estimated WTP by taking the negative ratio of preference and price parameters. Furthermore, we performed a stratified analysis according to the household head's ChD status. As expected, vaccines with higher efficacy and longer protection are most preferred. Interestingly, our research shows a preference for European and American vaccines over Chinese vaccines. Additionally, this study reveals a preference for private facilities over government facilities for vaccinations among vaccine seekers. Patients with ChD exhibit higher WTP than those without such conditions, demonstrating the group's urgency in becoming vaccinated. Vaccine procurement and administration decisions by health authorities should be evidence-based and reflect public preferences regarding acceptance and WTP. Health authorities should prioritize both high efficacy and long-lasting protection in vaccine procurement, ensuring that neither is compromised. This approach addresses the top concerns of both groups-vaccine effectiveness for the ChD group and extended immunity for the NChD group. This study also informs policy decisions regarding vaccine origin and suggests incorporating private facilities as vaccine administration points to reduce pressure on government facilities.",

        "abstract": "The Oropouche virus (OROV), an emerging arbovirus transmitted by arthropods, has caused significant outbreaks in South and Central America, with over half a million reported cases. Despite its public health threat, no approved vaccines or antiviral treatments exist for Oropouche fever (OF). This study explores the potential of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a bioactive polyphenol from green tea, as an antiviral agent against OROV using computational approaches. Due to the lack of experimentally resolved OROV protein structures, we employed AlphaFold2 to predict 3D models of key viral proteins, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelopment polyprotein, nucleoprotein, and glycoprotein Gc. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities between EGCG and these targets, with particularly high interactions for RNA polymerase (-7.1 kcal/mol) and envelopment polyprotein (-8.7 kcal/mol), suggesting the inhibition of viral replication and entry. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis identified critical human host genes (e.g., FCGR3A, IRF7, and IFNAR1) involved in immune responses, while Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses highlighted enriched antiviral and inflammatory pathways. ADMET profiling indicated challenges in EGCG's bioavailability, including poor gastrointestinal absorption and blood-brain barrier permeability, but its low toxicity and natural origin support its potential as a lead compound. These findings suggest that EGCG may disrupt OROV infection through multi-target mechanisms, warranting further experimental validation. This study provides a foundation for developing EGCG-based therapeutics against OROV and underscores the utility of computational methods in antiviral drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh first reported Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in 1977 and has seen regular cases since, however, no JEV vaccination program currently exists. A barrier to the use of JEV vaccines has been a limited understanding of the underlying burden. We conducted a nationally representative serological community study in 70 communities in individuals of all ages (N=2,938, October 2015-January 2016). Serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies against JEV. We developed spatially explicit serocatalytic models to estimate the underlying force of infection across the country. We then used mathematical models to estimate the annual JE disease burden currently and under different vaccination strategies. The overall JEV seroprevalence in Bangladesh was 3.4% (95%CI: 2.8-4.1, range 0-28% across communities). The annual probability of infection was 0.005 (95%CI: 0.003-0.009), with risk greatest near border regions. We estimated that annually there are 157 clinical cases (95%CI: 89-253) and 31 deaths (95%CI: 18-52). A vaccination strategy in the 10 most affected districts in 60% of 1-15 year olds would require 5 million doses and avert 1 case per 100,000 doses over five years compared to 35 million doses and 0.5 cases averted for a nationwide campaign. No vaccination scenario was cost-effective under a willingness-to-pay of three-times gross domestic product. A spatially targeted vaccine campaign would be most effective in reducing JEV burden, however, would still not meet standard cost effectiveness targets. CDC.",

        "title": "Pulmonary function and comparative SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgG antibody response among the COVID-19 recovered group.",
        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for millions of deaths and substantial morbidity worldwide. Several studies report that up to 50% of individuals who recover from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection experience a plethora of long-COVID symptoms that may persist for weeks, months, or even up to a year. Abnormal pulmonary function is one of the most critical manifestations of long-COVID, even after recovering from COVID-19. Understanding the long-term pulmonary consequences and immune response among individuals recovering from COVID-19, who experienced disease severity ranging from mild to severe, is crucial for comprehensive post-recovery care and vaccination strategies. This prospective case-control study included 29 individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 with a history of mild to severe symptoms and 64 controls. Assessments of pulmonary functional measures, such as FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, FEF, MEF, and PEF were carried out following recovery from COVID-19. Additionally, IgG antibody responses were examined by ELISA for up to six months through multiple follow-ups following two doses of vaccination, with an additional follow-up 30 days after the booster dose (third dose). Pulmonary functional abnormalities were prevalent in the recovered group, which had previously exhibited varying symptom severity (53% mild, 66% moderate, and 50% severe) compared to the control group (23%). Higher IgG antibody titers were observed among the recovered group, with significantly elevated titers in severe and moderate cases following vaccination. After vaccination, the recovered group showed significantly higher titers at day 14, particularly in the severe (1418 IU/mL) and moderate (1390 IU/mL) groups, compared to the control group (968 IU/mL) (p < 0.005). Notably, antibody titers were negatively correlated with pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters such as Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1). All groups experienced a significant (p < 0.005) decrease in antibody titers within 90-120 days after receiving two doses of vaccination. After five to six months, antibody titers returned to baseline levels, highlighting the importance of vaccination and additional booster doses regardless of previous infection history. Overall, our study underscores the significance of pulmonary function assessment post-COVID-19 recovery for long-term respiratory health and emphasizes the importance of vaccination regardless of infection history. To assess the impact of long-COVID on respiratory health, this study underscores the importance of evaluating pulmonary function in individuals, whether they had symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19. Furthermore, the findings from the immune response analysis highlight the critical role of vaccination, regardless of infection history, as a key strategy of pandemic preparedness.",

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is a major global health concern, primarily caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), which spreads through unsafe sexual contact. Natural immunity often fails to provide full protection, permitting exogenous reinfection, which plays a key role in the persistence and transmission of HPV. This paper presents and analyzes a deterministic mathematical model of HPV transmission, incorporating exogenous re-infection. We utilized VIA test result data from 2019 to 2023 in Bangladesh to estimate key parameter values. The findings were validated through numerical simulations using MATLAB, and the analytical results demonstrated strong consistency with the numerical outputs. A critical insight is the presence of reinfection-induced backward bifurcation, indicating that targeting primary infections alone is insufficient for eradication, highlighting the need to address exogenous reinfection for effective control. We propose optimal control strategies tailored to resource-limited settings like Bangladesh, where limited vaccine access presents significant challenges, and community-driven education on safe sexual practices is crucial and continuously evolving. The results emphasize that the most effective approach combines targeted prevention with widespread community education, while precision in intervention implementation is essential to prevent reinfection surges that could prolong disease persistence and undermine control efforts. These insights provide a strong foundation for refining intervention strategies and offer valuable guidance for controlling HPV transmission through non-pharmaceutical interventions, particularly in resource-constrained settings.",

The study aims to construct a multi-epitope vaccine targeting Monkeypox Virus (MPXV) membrane glycoprotein to provoke robust immune responses. To construct a potential immuno-dominant epitope vaccine to combat MPXV. The target sequence, sourced from the UAE-to-India travel case, was analyzed to identify potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes (MHC-I and MHC-II). Immunodominant epitopes were selected and fused with β-defensin-I and PADRE to increase immunogenicity. The vaccine was modeled, docked with TLR3, and subjected to a 500 ns molecular dynamics simulation for stability analysis. Immune responses and bacterial expression were also evaluated. The vaccine, comprising 230 amino acids, demonstrated antigenicity (0.6620), non-allergenicity, and broad population coverage. Selected epitopes included 3 B-cells, 4 MHC-I, and 2 MHC-II, ensuring a potent immunodominant profile. Docking with TLR3 revealed a binding affinity of -17.2 kcal/mol, while simulations confirmed their stability. Cloning (pET28a (+)) and immune response analyses showed a strong immunogenic profile, including elevated IgG1, IgM, and antigen levels, supported by a Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) of 1.0.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the clinico-molecular epidemiology of Protoparvovirus carnivoran1 infection in naturally infected domestic cats in Bangladesh. Rectal swabs (N = 100) were collected from cats manifesting clinical signs and screened for the presence of Protoparvovirus carnivoran1 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Selected positive samples (n = 38) were partially sequenced for molecular analysis. A structured questionnaire was developed to estimate potential risk factors for Protoparvovirus carnivoran1 infection, clinical and therapeutic outcomes and overall associations among the variables. Data were analysed using descriptive, univariable and multivariable statistical techniques. The overall PCR detection rate of the targeted Protoparvovirus carnivoran1 virus was 99% (99/100). Young and non-vaccinated animals were mostly infected (p < 0.05). The mortality and case fatality of infected cats were 10% and 45%, respectively. The clinical outcomes did not vary between animals receiving different therapeutic groups (p = 0.19). The phylogenetic analysis suggests that Protoparvovirus carnivoran1 isolates share a common ancestor with isolates from different global regions. The findings indicate that Protoparvovirus carnivoran1 is circulating in Bangladesh. The clinico-epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes can be used as a guide for future preventive and control measures against parvovirus infection, both locally and internationally.",

Infection with NiV leads to severe encephalitis and carries a case fatality rate ranging from 40% to 75%. The lack of a vaccine and limited understanding of NiV pathogenesis underscore the urgent need for effective therapeutics. This study focuses on identifying viral peptides of the Nipah virus using the peptide mass fingerprinting technique. This approach identified antiviral peptides acting as potent inhibitors, targeting the viral G-protein's interaction with cellular ephrin-B2 and B3 receptors. These receptors are crucial for viral entry into host cells and subsequent pathogenesis. Identifying NiV viral peptides not only enhances our understanding of the virus's structural and functional properties but also opens avenues for developing novel therapeutic strategies. By blocking the interaction between the viral G-protein and host receptors, these antiviral peptides offer promising prospects for drug development against NiV. Twenty-one peptides were identified using peptide mass fingerprinting. These peptides were then subjected to docking analysis with two antiviral peptides of the ephrin B2 receptor and a monoclonal antibody, demonstrating robust stability and binding affinity. These predicted peptides contribute to the broader field of virology by elucidating key aspects of NiV biology and paving the way for the development of targeted antiviral therapies.

The complete genome sequence was analyzed, and the potential B and T cells were predicted. Among the predicted epitopes, the promising ones were selected and further used with the adjuvant and linker to formulate a vaccine candidate. The vaccine was modeled, and its activity and stability towards the TLRs were analyzed via docking and dynamics (500ns). The vaccine-generated immune activity and expression via <i>in</i>-<i>silico</i> cloning were also evaluated. A total of 6 B cells, 7 CTL, and 6 HTL were identified as an immunodominant epitope and used for vaccine formulation. These epitopes were fused together via linkers, and their efficiency and constancy were enhanced with Adjuvant, PADRE epitope, and His-tag. Further, the formulated vaccine shows high population coverage and stable features based on the 2D and 3D assessments. The docking investigation demonstrated the strong activity of the vaccine towards the TLR2 and TLR3, having binding affinity − 10.8 kcal/mol-1 and − 15.8 kcal/mol-1, and also disclosed remarkable constancy based on the 500ns simulation period. The vaccine-assisted immune simulation and expression level in the vector revealed a robust immune response towards the host based on the vaccination and a significant expression level.

The virus also infects various animals, which often act as intermediate hosts in the transmission to humans. Due to the high fatality rates associated with Nipah virus outbreaks, the World Health Organization has flagged it as a significant public health concern, prompting extensive research into the development of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.

In this context, we propose a miRNA-based approach to identify key human cellular miRNAs capable of binding to and potentially cleaving or degrading Nipah virus genes implicated in human infections. Our study revealed a substantial number of miRNA binding sites across various viral genes, suggesting a potential mechanism for gene silencing. Furthermore, the calculated free energy values (< 4 kcal/mol) for all three regions; downstream, upstream and target indicate that the thermodynamically favorable binding could facilitate effective miRNA-mediated repressions of viral gene expression. Additionally, the translational efficiency and COSM values suggested swift miRNA-mediated cleavage or degradation of the viral genes. Moreover, analysis of the miRNA-mRNA duplex free energy and secondary structures, as predicted by RNAFold, indicated that the interactions between human miRNAs and Nipah virus genes were thermodynamically stable. These stable duplex formations support the potential for efficient binding, leading to effective gene silencing through cleavage or degradation mechanisms.",

During outbreaks, these diseases have huge socio-economic effects. Now, no vaccination that is effective against sheeppox, goatpox, and lumpy skin disease is available. This work used an immunoinformatic methodology to discover possible targets for vaccination against CPXV. After the 122 CPXV proteins were obtained from the Vipr database, several investigations into the proteins' virulence, antigenicity, toxicity, solubility, and IFN-g activity were carried out. Three outer membrane and extracellular proteins were selected to predict their B-cell and T-cell epitopes based on certain distinctive features. These epitopes exhibit conservation across three species, namely Sheeppox virus (SPPV), Goatpox virus (GTPV), and Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) of CPXV. This will provide more comprehensive immunity against diverse virus strains worldwide. Nine MHC-I, MHC-II, and B-cell epitopes were selected to generate multi-epitope vaccine constructions. These constructs were linked using AAY, GPGPG, and KK linkers and 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 adjuvants to enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccines. Molecular modeling and structural validation enabled the production of vaccine constructs with high-quality 3D structures. CPXV (Protein A35, Protein Resolve A22, and Scaffold Protein) was selected for further analysis because of its varied immunological and physiochemical properties (Number of Amino Acids, Molecular Weight (Daltons), Theoretical pI Aliphatic index, Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY), Instability index GC content, and CAI value) and docking scores. The bacterial expression system showed notable gene expression for the CPXV-V5 vaccine, as shown by computational cloning analysis. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed structural stability and long-term epitope visibility, implying strong immune responses after delivery. These results suggest that the developed vaccines might be quite safe and effective in practical settings, and they offer a solid foundation for further experimental verification.",

        "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a key driver of microbial evolution, promoting genetic diversity and contributing to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. This study explores the pangenome dynamics and HGT in <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i> (<i>M. marinum</i>), a close relative of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Multiple pangenome datasets were analyzed to quantify gene gain, loss, and pangenome openness, utilizing Panstripe and a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) framework to assess gene presence/absence across strains. Additionally, a comparative benchmarking analysis of gene ontology (GO) annotations were conducted using eggNOG and InterProScan to evaluate their functional annotation accuracy. Our findings demonstrated significant differences in gene gain and loss rates, suggesting variations in annotation accuracy and the presence of mobile genetic elements (MGE). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were also identified, highlighting the genetic variability that may impact strain-specific traits such as pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance. Pangenome of <i>M. marinum</i> was characterized as highly open, with substantial variability in gene content, reflecting ongoing genetic exchange and adaptability. Functional annotation benchmarking demonstrated that eggNOG and InterProScan provided complementary insights, with each tool excelling in distinct strengths of gene function identification. Overall, these findings highlight the complex interplay between HGT, pangenome evolution, and antibiotic resistance in <i>M. marinum</i>, and the analytical framework presented here provides a robust approach for future studies aiming to inform therapeutic interventions and vaccine development.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified pre-existing mental health issues in Bangladesh, yet no study has specifically examined how factors related to COVID-19 vaccination influence mental health within this context. This study aimed to examine the relationship between mental health symptoms, including depression, anxiety, and stress, and COVID-19 vaccination status and related factors among the adult Bangladeshi population. A cross-sectional study with a convenience sampling technique was employed to gather the data. The sample size and response rate were 1085 and 93.68%. The mean age of the participants was 34.30 (SD: 12.79), and 55.3% were female. Descriptive and inferential statistics were carried out. The reliability of the instruments, measured by Cronbach's alpha, was: depression (0.78), anxiety (0.82), stress (0.83), and overall DASS (0.92). The average number of COVID-19 vaccine doses taken was 2.33. Each additional dose of the COVID-19 vaccine significantly reduces stress scores by 0.61. Additionally, pre-vaccination concerns about side effects significantly increase anxiety scores by 0.63. Furthermore, experiencing pressure to get vaccinated is associated with a significant increase in depression scores by 0.78. Moreover, experiencing negative outcomes from the vaccine significantly decreases scores across all three mental health metrics: depression by -0.91, anxiety by -0.87, and stress by -1.35. This study reveals the broad psychological consequences of COVID-19 vaccination in Bangladesh, which underscore the importance of effective communication and supportive strategies, alongside targeted psychological interventions at vaccination sites.",

        "abstract": "This study seeks to investigate willingness to receive vaccination against NTDs using mRNA-based vaccines in various Asian countries, including China. Between June and December 2023, an anonymous cross-sectional survey was carried out in five countries. The survey assessed knowledge and attitudes regarding mRNA vaccines and their potential impact on vaccination acceptance. The majority indicated being somewhat willing (44.9%), 19.3% expressed extreme willingness. High knowledge scores (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.61, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.31-2.96] were associated with higher willingness to receive mRNA-based NTD vaccines. Participants from Bangladesh recorded the highest proportion expressed willingness (51.4%), followed by China (15.9%). Vietnam (15.4%) and Malaysia (14.8%). Pakistan (11.0%) and India (11.3%) recorded lowest proportions of willingness. Understanding the mechanism of mRNA vaccines and awareness of the difference between mRNA vaccines and conventional ones are knowledge items that significantly predict acceptance. Concerns regarding potential unknown side effects associated with mRNA-based approaches, and the perception that traditional vaccine development methods are safer, negatively correlate with willingness. Conversely, the belief in the advantages of mRNA-based approaches, such as rapid development, heightened potency, and reduced cost, positively correlates with willingness. High overall knowledge and attitudes scores were associated with a higher willingness to receive vaccines. The younger age group and females demonstrated a greater vaccination acceptance. Overall, the study highlights both opportunities and challenges in promoting the uptake of mRNA-based vaccines against NTDs in Asia countries. The study provides insights into enhancing knowledge and fostering positive attitudes toward mRNA-based vaccines.",

Serial passaging of the Peste Des Petits Ruminants virus (PPRV) in nonnative hosts can lead to mutations that potentially reduce pathogenicity. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effects of serial passaging of a Bangladeshi strain of PPR virus in Vero cells on the Fusion protein and pathogenicity MATERIALS AND METHODS: PPR viruses were initially isolated from natural PPR outbreaks, confirmed through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‒PCR), passaged to the 9th passage in Vero cells, sequenced, and preserved in a previous study. The 9th passage virus from the repository was utilized as the viral inoculant for further passaging in Vero cells, and the 60th passage was completed. The presence of PPR viral RNA was confirmed in tissue culture fluid (TCF) by RT‒PCR at different passage numbers. TCF at the 60th passage was sequenced and used for immunogenicity studies via live animal experiments, and subsequent immunity was measured via cELISA. Comparative analysis of the sequences from the 9th and 60th passages, along with other sequences, revealed substitutions of 14 nucleotides (nts) and 4 amino acids (aa) within the leucine zipper structure of the fusion protein. Notably, live animal experiments demonstrated the occurrence of protective immunity. This study suggests that amino acid substitution and genetic divergence may positively affect viral virulence, highlighting their importance in the development of a potent vaccine.",

        "abstract": "We use machine learning to identify innovative strategies to target azithromycin to the children with watery diarrhea who are most likely to benefit. Using data from a randomized trial of azithromycin for watery diarrhea (NCT03130114), we develop personalized treatment rules given sets of diagnostic, child, and clinical characteristics, employing a robust ensemble machine learning-based procedure. This procedure estimates the child-level expected benefit for a given set of covariates by combining predictions from a library of statistical models. For each rule, we estimate the proportion treated under the rule and the average benefits of treatment. Among 6692 children, treatment under the most comprehensive rule is recommended on average for one third of children. The risk of diarrhea on day 3 is 10.1% lower (95% CI: 5.4, 14.9) with azithromycin compared to placebo among children recommended for treatment (NNT: 10). For day 90 re-hospitalization and death, risk is 2.4% lower (95% CI: 0.6, 4.1; NNT: 42). While pathogen diagnostics are strong determinants of azithromycin effects on diarrhea duration, host characteristics may better predict benefits for re-hospitalization or death. This suggests that targeting antibiotic treatment for severe outcomes among children with watery diarrhea may be possible without access to pathogen diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated robust vaccination strategies, including booster doses to sustain immunity against SARS-CoV-2. The comparative immunogenicity of homologous (same vaccine type) versus heterologous (different vaccine types) booster regimens remains understudied, particularly in diverse settings. This study assesses anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG antibody responses to these regimens in Bangladesh. A prospective quasi-experimental study was conducted at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from March 2022 to February 2023. Seventy-three participants, selected via convenience sampling, were grouped into homologous (n=40) or heterologous (n=33) vaccine regimens based on primary and booster vaccine types. Anti-RBD IgG levels were measured pre-booster and three weeks post-booster using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant Reagent Kit (Abbott, Ireland). Demographic and clinical factors (age, sex, BMI, diabetes, and blood pressure) were evaluated. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used, with p≤0.05 indicating significance. Participants (mean age: 35.51 years, 79.5% male) showed higher pre-booster (median: 4499.65 vs. 1863.7 AU/mL, p<0.001) and post-booster (median: 13835.15 vs. 10423.3 AU/mL, p=0.014) anti-RBD IgG levels in the homologous group compared to the heterologous group. However, the heterologous group exhibited a greater fold increase (median: 4.6 vs. 3.65, p=0.024) of anti-RBD IgG levels. A higher proportion of participants in the homologous regimen achieved high post-booster IgG levels (>20,000 AU/mL, p=0.016). Diabetes significantly reduced antibody responses in the heterologous group (p=0.006). Hypertensive participants had significantly reduced antibody responses before (p=0.005) and after (p=0.001) the booster in the heterologous group and after (p=0.033) the booster in the homologous group. Age, sex, and BMI had no significant effect on the results. Homologous regimens yield higher anti-RBD IgG levels, while heterologous regimens produce greater fold increases of anti-RBD IgG levels, indicating robust recall. Diabetes and hypertension impair responses, particularly in heterologous regimens. These findings support the need for tailored vaccination strategies to enhance immune protection.",

Plasma concentrations of anti-HlyE and LPS IgA were measured in blood culture-confirmed enteric fever cases and in febrile controls with laboratory-confirmed alternative etiology. Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed that combining anti-LPS and HlyE IgA distinguished enteric fever cases from other febrile illnesses with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93. Anti-LPS IgA alone performed nearly as well (AUC 0.92). In children under 5, the combination outperformed individual biomarkers (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94 (HlyE), 0.93 (LPS)) and was most accurate in Bangladesh and Pakistan compared to Nepal.

        "abstract": "Mpox, a viral disease, caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV) has been a public health emergency of international concern since 2024. The absence of any mpox-specific treatment or vaccine, along with the emergence of new variants like Clade Ib, underscores the urgent need for targeted vaccine development. To address the challenge, this study employed reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics approaches to design a multi-epitope vaccine against MPXV. The vaccine construct includes four Linear B lymphocyte (LBL), nine Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), and seven Helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes. LBL epitopes were selected from six membrane glycoproteins of the virus and the T-cell epitopes were selected from the experimentally validated conserved epitopes of the similar orthopoxviruses. These epitopes were combined with appropriate linkers and adjuvants to enhance structural flexibility, immunogenicity, and potency. The engineered vaccine underwent rigorous evaluation, considering physicochemical properties, structural integrity, population coverage, and immune system response through simulation. The 3D structure of the vaccine was predicted, optimized, and docking analysis revealed robust interactions with the human Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 (TLR-2 and TLR-4), supported by highly negative HADDOCK scores and low RMSD values. The stability of the vaccine construct and its stable interaction with TLR-2 and TLR-4 were confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Additionally, the immune simulation results showed that the vaccination significantly increased IgM levels during the primary response, while IgG subtypes as well as combined IgM and IgG levels nearly doubled in the secondary and tertiary responses. <i>In silico</i> expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) further confirmed its potential for production. Overall, this study presents a highly immunogenic and promising vaccine candidate against MPXV that demands experimental validation for clinical application.",

New evidence has emerged and the ways in which the vaccines are used have changed. We aimed to provide an updated synthesis of evidence on protection conferred by kOCV. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we used the same search procedure as a previous systematic review to identify randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies that reported estimates of protection conferred by kOCVs against medically attended, confirmed cholera. Eligible studies in English, French, Spanish, or Chinese published up until March 8, 2024, including those identified in the previous review, were included. Data on efficacy and effectiveness were extracted, as were the number of doses, duration of follow-up, and age group. Efficacy and effectiveness estimates were summarised separately using random-effect models to estimate protection by time since vaccination; meta-regression models were used to estimate protection, by dose, as a function of time since vaccination. This updated study is registered along with the original review with PROSPERO (CRD42016048232). We identified 8205 records published online up until March 8, 2024, including 6224 articles from the previous review and 1981 articles from our new search (after Jan 1, 2016). Of these, 53 were eligible for full-text review. Five RCTs and ten observational studies from 23 publications were included. Average two-dose efficacy 12 months after vaccination was 55% (95% CI 46-62), declining to 44% (25-59) 48 months after vaccination. Average two-dose effectiveness was 69% (58-78) 12 months after vaccination, declining to 47% (9-70) 48 months after vaccination. Only one RCT assessed one-dose efficacy and found sustained protection for 24 months (57% [42-69]) among those 5 years and older with no significant protection in younger children. Average one-dose effectiveness 12 months after vaccination was 60% (51-68) and after 24 months was 47% (34-58). Using age group-specific meta-analysis, we found that average two-dose efficacy in children younger than 5 years was half that of older individuals. Two doses of kOCV provide protection against medically attended cholera for at least 4 years after vaccination. One dose of kOCV provides protection for at least 2 years after vaccination, but wanes faster than that of two doses. Children younger than 5 years are less protected by kOCVs than those aged 5 years and older, regardless of the number of doses received. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

The study was conducted in four hospitals in Dhaka between December 30, 2021, and August 31, 2022 following a test-negative design. Patients aged ≥18 years attended with COVID-like symptoms were enrolled and tested for RT-PCR. Test-negative controls were matched to confirmed cases at a 1:1 ratio considering site, date, and age groups. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the PE considering the association between receipt of complete primary with or without a booster regimen and development of COVID-19 disease symptoms. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out to confirm the variants. RT-PCR positive 847 cases were matched to 847 controls. WGS of strains revealed 6% to be the Delta variant and 94% was Omicron variant. The PE conferred by receipt of complete primary regimen with or without booster dose of any vaccine revealed no significant protection (15%, 95% CI: -11 to 36, <i>p</i> = .23) against any COVID-19 disease or severe disease (14%, 95%CI: -23 to 39, <i>p</i> = .42).

This work will show how strong the bacteria are and how important they are for public health. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform, followed by comprehensive analysis with various bioinformatic tools to identify key genomic features. WGS revealed that the isolates are closely related, belonging to sequence type ST4, a rare type previously identified in both human and animal hosts. The isolates possess 44 virulence-related genes linked to adherence, capsule biogenesis, enzyme production, immunoreactive antigens, protease, and cytolysin production. They also carry two pilus islands (PIs), PI-1 and PI-2b, which are often associated with invasive diseases. PI-2b proteins are key targets for vaccine development against Group B Streptococcus (GBS). The isolates belong to serotype Ia and carry the gbs2018-2 variant, indicating their adaptability to a wide range of hosts, including humans and animals. These virulence factors are critical for understanding <i>S. agalactiae'</i>s pathogenicity and developing vaccines against its infections. Additionally, the isolates harbor antimicrobial resistance genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides (<i>vanT</i>, <i>vanY</i>), macrolides (<i>mreA</i>), peptides (<i>mprF</i>), penicillins and <i>β</i>-lactams (<i>pbp</i>), and aminoglycosides. Source tracking via the BacWGSTdb website identified these isolates as closely related to human pathogens, indicating their zoonotic potential.

The proportion of diarrhea-related deaths was highest in Ethiopia (41.0%, 34/83), followed by Bangladesh, (30.0%, 3/10), Mozambique (21.7%, 56/258), Mali (17.5%, 18/103), Kenya (13.9%, 51/366), Sierra Leone (12.8%, 46/358), and South Africa (9.4%, 32/339). Diarrhea was underlying cause in 44.2% (106/240) of cases and immediate/antecedent cause in 58.3% (140/240), with some deaths involving multiple roles in the causal chain. When diarrhea was underlying cause, sepsis (33.0%) and lower respiratory infections (25.5%) were common downstream conditions; when an antecedent/immediate cause, leading underlying causes were malnutrition (64.3%) and HIV (13.6%). No pathogen was identified in 49.6% (119/240) of diarrhea-related deaths; among these, diarrhea was underlying cause in 42.9%. Among the 121 pathogen-attributed deaths, the most frequent were EAEC (34.7%), typical EPEC (15.7%), Shigella/EIEC (14.0%), ST-ETEC (12.4%), rotavirus (26.4%), and adenovirus (non-40/41: 19.0%; 40/41: 5.0%). These pathogens were frequently identified as co-infections. Diarrheal disease accounted for a substantial share of child deaths across CHAMPS sites. Reducing mortality will require preventing diarrhea and addressing key contributors such as malnutrition and HIV.",

        "abstract": "Childhood vaccination is the most cost-effective public health intervention; however, coverage in slum-like areas remains a significant challenge because of unique socio-economic disparities and logistical barriers. We aimed to evaluate the interventions from the literature on improving vaccination coverage among children aged 12-23 months in slum areas using the WHO iEtD framework and the TOPSIS-Entropy method for decision-making in Bangladesh and identify stakeholders ranks and felt needs of interventions across study slums. This cross-sectional study was conducted in six slums in two city corporation areas in Dhaka, Bangladesh involving 67 demand-side and 35 supply-side stakeholders. Rating scores ranged from 0 to 1, indicating priority interventions. Our study highlights that demand-side stakeholders favour incentive interventions, whereas supply-side stakeholders support multicomponent strategies. For all stakeholders, educational interventions were ranked highest with a score of 0.745, followed by multicomponent interventions (score 0.666), incentive (score 0.651), and reminder/recall scoring (score 0.305). Educational interventions were identified as a shared priority (common ground), addressing the felt needs of both demand- and supply-side stakeholders. These findings support tailored context-specific approaches to enhance vaccination coverage and child health in vulnerable communities.",

        "abstract": "Newborns infected with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) are at risk of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. This study investigated the prevalence of HBV infection among pregnant women and cord blood Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity of their newborns in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Kenya, Nigeria, Mali, and South Africa. Randomly selected paired maternal and cord blood samples (n = 101 each site) taken at delivery were tested for HBsAg and Hepatitis B extractable antigen (HBeAg) in the women using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Similarly, cord blood sample of newborn was assessed for HBsAg reactivity. HBV DNA was quantified using the Xpert® HBV viral load assay, followed by genotyping. The overall prevalence of maternal HBsAg positivity was 5.5 % (95 %CI: 0.4 %-7.1 %; n = 50/909). HBsAg positivity was higher in African countries (7.3 %; 95 %CI: 5.4 %-9.6 %; n = 44/606) compared to South Asian countries (2.0 %; 95 %CI: 0.8 %-4.3 %; n = 6/303; p = 0.002). Relative to South Africa, there were higher odds of HBsAg sero-positivity in women from Mozambique ((aOR): 7.7, 95 %CI: 1.6 %-37.8 %) and Mali (aOR: 5.7; 95 %CI: 1.1 %-29.7 %). The rate of HBsAg positivity in cord blood of babies born to HBsAg positive women was 28.0 % (95 %CI: 17.1 %-42.3 %; n = 14/50), including 31.8 % (95 %CI: 19.5-47.4 %; n = 14/44) in African countries. No cord blood HBsAg positivity was observed in South Asia. Genotypic analysis revealed HBV genotypes A (41.7 %) and E (58.3 %) were pre-dominant. The high rate of cord blood positivity (28.0 %) for HBsAg underscores the urgency of enhancing HBV prevention strategies to meet the World Health Organization's target of a 90 % reduction in new HBV infections by 2030.",

        "title": "Determinants of incomplete immunization and factors for missed opportunities in urban Dhaka: A cross-sectional study.",
        "abstract": "Most vaccinations in the immunization schedule need two or more doses to elicit a protective immune response. Therefore, completion of all doses is crucial for achieving the best possible immunity. The objective of this study was to investigate the factors influencing missed opportunities of polio vaccination in children between the ages of 1-3 years in urban Dhaka. In 2018, according to the immunization card records or histories from parents/guardians, we sorted1-3-year-old children from areas of Dhaka South City Corporation who were not fully immunized. Immunization records were obtained from the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) card or maternal recall. Reasons for non-vaccination were documented. A total of 501 children were tracked down to determine the causes of their incomplete polio doses. Determinants of incomplete immunization and factors for missed opportunities were assessed by using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression model. The households with a child who had not received all the recommended vaccines had a considerably lower monthly income (18,000 BDT; p < 0.001). In both the complete and partial vaccination groups, the average family size was five people, and the average child age was 28 months. Education level of the household head after adjustment (AOR), the odds of the event occurring decrease by 25% with primary education (95% CI: 0.66, 0.85), p-value: < 0.001). Occupation of the household head for rickshaw/van/cart puller, AOR, the odds increase even more, with the event being 3.15 times more likely for this occupation (95% CI: 1.95, 5.08) and statistical significance (p-value < 0.05). Again, for daily wager AOR, 2.16 times higher for daily wagers (95% CI: 1.35, 3.45) and statistical significance (p-value: 0.001). This study identifies sociodemographic factors that influence incomplete childhood immunization in this urban area of Dhaka. In order to improve the coverage, the identified factors need to be mitigated and policymakers should focus on enhancing community engagement, combating misinformation and increasing the accessibility of vaccination services.",

        "abstract": "Replacing oral polio vaccines with inactivated polio vaccines (IPVs) is necessary to stop the potential transmission of vaccine-derived polio viruses. We aimed to compare the safety and immunogenicity of a dose-sparing IPV (ds-IPV) with a full-dose IPV in infants in Bangladesh. This double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 3 study was done at two field sites in Bangladesh (Kamlapur and Matlab). Eligible participants were healthy infants aged 6-8 weeks, with parents who intended to reside in the area during the study period. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to receive either ds-IPV from one of the three lots (lot A, B, or C; Serum Institute of India, Pune, India) or an IPV (Serum Institute of India). Three intramuscular doses (0·5 mL) were administered at age 6, 10, and 14 weeks in addition to other standard vaccines. The study staff involved in safety evaluation, study procedures, parents of the participants, and the laboratory personnel were masked to the treatment allocations. The primary endpoint was seroconversion for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 at 28 days after the third dose, assessed in the per-protocol and full analysis populations. Solicited adverse events were collected up to 4 days after each vaccine dose and unsolicited adverse events and serious adverse events were collected up to 28 days after the third dose. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05163561, and is complete. Between Jan 9, 2022, and April 29, 2023, 1072 eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive ds-IPV (n=801) or IPV (n=267), of whom 1052 completed the study. 755 (96% [95% CI 94 to 97]) of 786 participants in the ds-IPV group versus 256 (97% [94 to 98]) of 265 participants in the IPV group had seroconversion for poliovirus type 1 (difference -0·55% [95% CI -3·05 to 1·95]). 744 (95% [93 to 96]) of 786 participants in the ds-IPV group versus 261 (98% [96 to 100]) of 265 participants in the IPV group had seroconversion for poliovirus type 2 (difference -3·83% [-6·48 to -1·19]). 765 (97% [96 to 98]) of 786 participants in the ds-IPV group versus 260 (98% [96 to 99]) of 265 participants in the IPV group had seroconversion for poliovirus type 3 (difference -0·78% [-2·73 to 1·16]). Solicited events were observed in 446 (56%) of 801 participants in the ds-IPV group and 143 (54%) of 267 participants in the IPV group. Unsolicited events were observed in 746 (93%) of 801 participants in the ds-IPV group and 250 (94%) of 267 participants in the IPV group. Serious adverse events were observed in 23 (3%) of 801 participants in the ds-IPV group and five (2%) of 267 participants in the IPV group. The common serious adverse events were pneumonia (n=10 in the ds-IPV group; n=3 in the IPV group), bronchiolitis (n=3 in the ds-IPV group; n=1 in the IPV group), and diarrhoea (n=3 in the ds-IPV group; n=1 in the IPV group). None of the unsolicited events and serious adverse events were causally related to the study vaccines. Delivery of three intramuscular doses of the novel ds-IPV vaccine is safe and immunologically non-inferior to the delivery of three intramuscular doses of IPV, and the dose sparing formulation might therefore become an attractive option for some national immunisation programmes due to lower expected vaccine costs.

However, this collaboration has not been translated into actionable control policies, which coupled with low vaccination coverage, impose a substantial health and economic burden in Bangladesh. Critical gaps remain in understanding the influenza burden among high-risk populations and the barriers influencing their vaccine uptake. These gaps hinder the development of evidence-based strategies for prevention and control, consequently leaving the country vulnerable to a potentially catastrophic influenza epidemic. These challenges require a multifaceted approach, including continuous local data collection on disease burden and vaccine barriers, vaccine cost-effectiveness analyses, and the design of context-specific interventions. Leveraging existing infrastructures offers opportunities to develop tailored strategies for high-risk populations. A robust national influenza policy is imperative to mitigate the burden and reduce future pandemic threats.",

        "title": "Awareness about cervical cancer and its socio-economic determinants among adults in Bangladesh: Results from a nationwide cross-sectional study.",
        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is a major global health issue now and is the second leading cancer among women in Bangladesh, caused primarily by Human papillomavirus (HPV). Despite effective vaccination and screening methods, awareness and access to preventive methods are limited in developing regions. This nationwide study aims to explore socio-economic and cultural factors affecting cervical cancer awareness in Bangladesh and generate evidence-based recommendations for tailoring suitable health promotion strategies for the country. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Bangladesh to evaluate cervical cancer awareness among adults aged 18 years and above. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed for this research, keeping in mind the local sociocultural contexts. Face-to-face interviews were conducted after getting the participants' consent and making sure they understood all the questions. After checking for data quality and consistency, responses of 2,151 participants were finally retained. The collected data was analyzed using STATA (Version 17) statistical software. The majority (80.15%) of the participants were aware of cervical cancer, with healthcare workers being the primary source of information. Higher awareness rates were noted among married individuals (80.88%), urban dwellers (83.24%), those with more education (average 11.96 ± 4.36 years), individuals with higher income (88.17%), and those belonging to nuclear families (82.86%). Healthcare professionals had significantly greater awareness (98.91%) compared to other occupations. Participants undergoing regular health checkups were more informed and the association was statistically significant (87.03%, p < 0.001). Univariate and multiple logistic regression models revealed that each additional year of education increased the probability of being aware by 16-20%. Men had significantly lower odds of being aware compared to women (Adjusted Odds Ratio AOR = 0.41, β = -0.895, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.70, p = 0.001 in the multiple logistic regression analysis). Similarly, respondents not cohabitating with their spouse were less aware than those who were living with partners (AOR = 0.47, β = -0.750, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.81, p = 0.006). Income levels conversely influenced awareness level, participants from the highest income group (earning 35,001-50,000 BDT) had 47% lower odds (AOR = 0.53, β = -0.629, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.80, p = 0.002) of awareness compared to the lowest income group (earning ≤20,000 BDT). Despite the widespread awareness of cervical cancer among most Bangladeshi adults, there remains a notable gap, particularly among certain demographics. Since the study identified healthcare workers, social media, and mass media as major sources of information, targeted educational campaigns through media channels and outreach activities by healthcare workers might effectively enhance nationwide awareness of cervical cancer.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the demographic, temporal, and spatial characteristics of animal bite (AB) cases in humans across 12 Upazilas within Mymensingh district of Bangladesh. Retrospective hospital-based data from individual AB cases for 2022 and 2023 were collected from S.K Hospital. The dataset included information on victim demographics, bite details, vaccination information, and Rabies Immune Globulin (RIG) administration. Additionally, monthly case counts from 2016 to 2024 were sourced and analyzed to identify trends. Descriptive statistics and time series analysis using the seasonal decomposition technique were conducted. Risk maps for animal bites in 2022 and 2023 were generated using a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) approach. An almost two-fold increase in the proportion of category 3 bites receiving RIG from 3.6% in 2022 to 6.5% in 2023 was noted. Only 9.7% (2022) and 16.9% (2023) of bite victims received PEP on the day of exposure, whereas 76.5% (2022) and 84.6% (2023) received PEP within 24 hours. Moreover, significant seasonal patterns and annual increasing trends in AB cases were observed. Males and children under 14 years old had a higher risk of being bitten. Dogs (48.2% in 2022) and cats (52.6% in 2023) were identified as the primary animals responsible for the bites. Notably, the legs were the body part most frequently bitten. The bites risk map identified four high risk Upazilas. Despite improvements in PEP coverage achieved within 24 hours, a critical gap remains in same-day PEP coverage in both years. The study results also suggest other potential improvements in healthcare practices or treatment protocols, and the need for a veterinary surveillance system. Increasing AB cases highlight the need to enhance surveillance and control measures. Targeted awareness campaigns tailored to high-risk groups such as males and children under 14 years of age, along with preventive programs focused on dogs are imperative. Coordinated One Health efforts among healthcare professionals, veterinarians, policymakers, and community stakeholders are crucial to effectively mitigate the incidence of AB cases, safeguarding public health and eliminate dog mediated rabies by 2030 in the region.",

        "abstract": "In-hospital mortality during COVID-19 treatment is a crucial metric used to assess the severity of the disease and the effectiveness of medical interventions. By identifying mortality risk factors, we aim to inform policy decisions, optimize resource allocation, and improve preparedness for future pandemics. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Data were gathered from the hospital's electronic medical records between July 2021 and September 2021. After applying specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 218 patients with complete medical records were selected for the analysis. The independent variables examined included demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and clinical features. To assess in-hospital mortality, relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analysis employing the Delta method. The study included 218 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, primarily male (51.4%) with an average age of 56.4 years (standard deviation of 15 years). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 18.3%. Older age (≥60) (RR:3.10, 95% CI: 1.16-8.29), long-standing hypertension (≥5 years) (RR:2.78, 95% CI:1.54-5.02), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (RR:4.43, 95% CI:2.93-6.70) were significant risk factors for mortality. Patients with diabetes (≥3 years) had a moderately increased risk (RR:1.68, 95% CI: 1.01-2.83). Notably, shorter hospital stays (≤7 days) were associated with higher mortality, potentially due to delayed treatment initiation. Moreover, Vaccinated patients have a significantly lower risk of death (RR: 0.07) compared to unvaccinated patients, highlighting the protective effect of vaccination. Greater lung involvement (especially in lower lobes) and higher Total Severity Scores (TSS ≥ 14) strongly predict COVID-19 mortality, with non-survivors exhibiting significantly worse radiographic damage. Age, particularly when combined with chronic conditions like hypertension or chronic kidney disease, is a key predictor of in-hospital COVID-19 mortality. While gender is not an independent risk factor, males tend to have higher mortality rates. Delayed treatment, reflected by shorter hospital stays, also increases risk. Vaccination markedly lowers mortality. In resource-limited settings, lower lobe involvement >50% and TSS ≥ 14 can serve as early triage markers to guide ICU admission or intensified care. These indicators should inform risk assessment tools, resource allocation, and targeted interventions to reduce pandemic-related mortality.",

        "abstract": "Multi-pathogen molecular diagnostics enhance our understanding of the pathogen-specific burden of diarrhea. However, attributing etiology remains challenging in high-burden settings where coinfections are common. The Antibiotics for Children with severe Diarrhea (ABCD) trial provides a unique opportunity to leverage azithromycin treatment response to identify bacterial diarrhea. We analyzed data from 6,692 children with watery diarrhea enrolled in ABCD (2017 to 2019) who were randomized to receive azithromycin or placebo. We modelled the heterogeneity in the azithromycin treatment response by the enteric pathogen quantity detected by quantitative PCR using log-binomial regression. Azithromycin treatment response varied by pathogen quantity, with the strongest effect observed for <i>Shigella</i>. Each log₁₀ increase in <i>Shigella</i> quantity was associated with a 13% reduction (95% CI: 3-23%) in diarrhea risk at day 3 in the azithromycin group compared to placebo. We observed similar, though non-significant, trends for <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, ST-ETEC, and tEPEC. In contrast, no association was found between pathogen quantity and azithromycin response for <i>Campylobacter</i>, LT-ETEC, or EAEC. These patterns remained consistent when evaluating hospitalization or death risk within 90 days. The observed associations between azithromycin treatment response and pathogen quantity for <i>Shigella</i>, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, ST-ETEC, and tEPEC support prior evidence that these pathogens are likely causes of diarrhea when present in high quantities. Conversely, the absence of a similar response pattern for <i>Campylobacter</i>, LT-ETEC, and EAEC is consistent with large-scale studies showing a limited association between their quantities and diarrhea.",

        "abstract": "Currently, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection is one of the leading complications in public health and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), especially in the African region. No specific vaccine is available to combat this, with multi-strain variability being one of the hurdles. In this investigation, we employed variability in the epitope of the HIV subtype C targets to introduce mutations and construct an epitope-based vaccine. Four targets were examined to predict the B and T cells (major histocompatibility complex class I and II). Among the predicted epitopes, immunodominant epitopes were selected and were mapped with the identified variable amino acid to incorporate mutation. These selected and mutated epitopes were used for the non-mutated and mutated vaccine construction, considering linker for fusion and adjuvant to improve the activity. The vaccine's structure was modeled and examined to validate its structural quality, and a high population coverage was also found. The docking investigation of the non-mutated and mutated vaccine with Toll-like receptor 3 shows remarkable activity followed by strong binding affinity, and the simulation of over 100 ns revealed the constancy of the complex system. The immune response revealed its strong effectiveness by generating multiple immunoglobulins followed by the time step of infection, and further, <i>in silico</i> cloning demonstrated a high expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> based on their favorable Codon Adaptation Index and GC value. The integrated approach in this investigation will help to plan a potent immunodominant vaccine that can work for multiple strains of HIV infection.",

        "abstract": "Endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43) are common causes of mild or asymptomatic respiratory infections in children but are considered rare causes of death. We evaluated pediatric deaths from January 2017 through December 2022. A panel of experts determined the cause of death (CoD) by reviewing available data, including pathological and molecular findings from minimally invasive tissue sampling (lung tissues, blood, CSF, and nasopharyngeal swabs), clinical records, and verbal autopsies. Endemic HCoV were detected in the respiratory samples of 3 % (n = 86/3357) of enrolled decedents: 1 % (n = 12/2043) of neonates, 5 % (n = 35/681) of infants and 6 % (n = 39/633) of children deaths. However, HCoVs were attributed as the CoD in only two cases - both involving young infants with underlying birth defects and severe wasting, who succumbed to polymicrobial hospital-acquired infections involving HCoV-OC43, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Amongst the remaining 84 decedents in whom an HCoV was detected, 82 % (n = 69/84; median Ct of 25.34; range: 15.28-36.17) were deaths attributed to other infections, including 54 % (n = 32/69; median Ct of 23.86; range: 15.28-35.2) with lower respiratory infections determined to be the CoD. The bulk of these deaths (96 %, n = 66/69) were attributed to other pathogens - Plasmodium falciparum (27 %, n = 19/69), K. pneumoniae (23 %, n = 16/69), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20 %, n = 14/69), Escherichia coli (16 %, n = 11/69) and Cytomegalovirus (10 %, n = 7/69). Although endemic HCoV was identified in children who died of respiratory infections, it was rarely attributed to being in the CoD. Nevertheless, further research is warranted to explore the potential role of HCoVs in LRTI pathogenesis and their impact on facilitating more pathogenic infections.",

        "abstract": "Dengue, caused by the dengue virus (DENV), is the fastest-growing mosquito-borne disease worldwide. We utilised monthly data on dengue cases and deaths reported through the World Health Organisation's (WHO) global surveillance system for the period of 1<sup>st</sup> January to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2024. We then performed a generalised linear regression model to understand country-level determinants of dengue-related mortality. In 2024, 14.1 million dengue cases were reported globally, surpassing the historic milestone of 7 million observed in 2023. This figure represents a twofold increase compared to 2023 and a 12-fold rise compared to 2014 (n=1,206,644). In 2024, 9,508 dengue-related deaths were recorded, resulting in a global case-fatality rate of 0.07%. In the regression analysis, countries in the Southern hemisphere (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 5.95, 95% CI: 4.19-8.46), aged population (IRR 1.04, CI: 1.01-1.07), and mean annual temperature (IRR 1.21, CI: 1.16-1.26) were significantly associated with higher dengue-related mortality per million population.

Among them, the concept of \"disease X\" has emerged owing to the uncertainty about the identity of the pathogen that may cause the next pandemic. Disease X has gained significant attention due to its potential to cause a public health emergency in the future. This study aimed to investigate disease X, identify the key risk factors leading to its emergence and spread, and propose strategies to prevent future global pandemics. We performed a comprehensive literature review and identified relevant information for this study. Pandemic, public health emergency, and infectious disease were used as keywords for the literature search. Our study indicates that disease X could be a life-threatening or global pandemic. Among the various risk factors, climate change, increased animal-human contact, and the emergence of antibiotic resistance are some risk factors that may lead to a pandemic because they help in the transmission of zoonotic infections. Here, we have discussed some potential pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, that are capable of causing disease X. Finally, we have indicated some necessary measures required for the prevention and management of any future global pandemic. Disease X has already posed a substantial threat to the global health system, warranting urgent attention and action. Comprehensive preparedness measures, including robust surveillance systems, early detection, and vaccine development, are essential for mitigating the risk posed by disease X.

        "abstract": "The Dinga Dinga Virus (DDV) has emerged as a mysterious disease gripping women in Uganda, raising alarm due to its unusual and distressing \"dancing\" like symptoms. These symptoms, characterized by involuntary movements resembling dance, suggest possible neurological involvement, though the exact pathogen remains unidentified. The causative agent for DDV is still unknown. We hypothesized that the possible microorganism could be a virus, bacteria, or vector-borne origin. Therefore, comprehensive research is urgently needed to confirm its cause. We performed a comprehensive literature search in Scopus and Web of Science related to the different outbreaks of viruses. We collected relevant information from appropriate articles for this review. The unique representation of the disease is spreading rapidly in localized areas that have the potential to escalate into a broader public health crisis. Preventive measures focused on symptom monitoring, public awareness, and isolation of suspected cases to limit transmission. Authorities emphasize hygiene practices, using personal protective equipment (PPE), and early reporting to manage the outbreak effectively. Simultaneously, global health organizations are being called to collaborate on diagnostic development, therapeutic interventions, and vaccine research. The disproportionate impact on women has brought social and cultural dynamics into the spotlight, as stigma and misinformation exacerbate the outbreak's challenges. Immediate and long-term strategies must address these aspects by strengthening healthcare infrastructure and enhancing disease surveillance systems. As the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, the DDV is a stark reminder of the ongoing threat of emerging infectious diseases. Proactive, science-driven efforts are critical to understanding and mitigating this enigmatic disease, ensuring it does not escalate into another global health crisis.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Oropouche virus (OROV), part of the Peribunyaviridae family, is an emerging pathogen causing Oropouche fever, a febrile illness endemic in South and Central America. Transmitted primarily through midge bites (<i>Culicoides paraensis</i>), OROV has no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. This study aims to identify host-targeted therapeutics against OROV using computational approaches, offering a potential strategy for sustainable antiviral drug discovery. <b>Methods:</b> Virus-associated host targets were identified using the OMIM and GeneCards databases. The Enrichr and DSigDB platforms were used for drug prediction, filtering compounds based on Lipinski's rule for drug likeness. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was conducted using the STRING database and Cytoscape 3.10.3 software. Four key host targets-IL10, FASLG, PTPRC, and FCGR3A-were prioritized based on their roles in immune modulation and OROV pathogenesis. Molecular docking simulations were performed using the PyRx software to evaluate the binding affinities of selected small-molecule inhibitors-Acetohexamide, Deptropine, Methotrexate, Retinoic Acid, and 3-Azido-3-deoxythymidine-against the identified targets. <b>Results:</b> The PPI network analysis highlighted immune-mediated pathways such as Fc-gamma receptor signaling, cytokine control, and T-cell receptor signaling as critical intervention points. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities between the selected compounds and the prioritized targets, suggesting their potential efficacy as host-targeting antiviral candidates. Acetohexamide and Deptropine showed strong binding to multiple targets, indicating broad-spectrum antiviral potential. Further in vitro and in vivo validations are needed to confirm these findings and translate them into clinically relevant treatments. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study highlights the potential of using computational approaches to identify host-targeted therapeutics for Oropouche virus (OROV). By targeting key host proteins involved in immune modulation-IL10, FASLG, PTPRC, and FCGR3A-the selected compounds, Acetohexamide and Deptropine, demonstrate strong binding affinities, suggesting their potential as broad-spectrum antiviral candidates. Further experimental validation is needed to confirm their efficacy and potential for clinical application, offering a promising strategy for sustainable antiviral drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the spread of COVID-19 in humanitarian and fragile settings is challenging for many reasons, including the lack of data on social dynamics and preventive behaviors during an epidemic. We investigate social interactions in three such settings - Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Central African Republic (CAR), Cox's Bazar (CXB), Bangladesh - and how they changed during the first year of the pandemic. This comparative mixed-methods study uses a representative household survey and focus group discussions or key informant interviews in each site. Descriptive weighted analysis of survey responses was conducted; multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with changes in social interactions. Thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative data. Nearly all participants had social interactions the day before the survey, although the average number of daily interactions was low. Interactions primarily occurred indoors, at home and without masks. We saw a discrepancy between knowledge about and practice of preventive behaviors. Most respondents reported interacting less often (77.3% CXB, 86.7% CAR, 58.8% DRC) and having shorter meetings (80% CXB, 77.8% CAR, and 47.8% DRC). Reluctance towards the COVID-19 vaccine was a risk factor for non-compliant behaviors in CAR (OR increased frequency = 3.51, 95%CI = 1.41-8.75; OR increased duration = 2.47, 95%CI = 1.15-5.29) and DRC (OR increased duration = 3.06, 95%CI = 1.71-5.49), likely pointing to distrust towards institutional policies. Respondents from IDP communities in DRC were less likely to reduce the frequency of interaction, likely because living conditions did not facilitate physical distancing. Increased knowledge in CXB was associated with compliant behavior (for 1pt-increase: OR increased frequency = 0.47, 95%CI = 0.32-0.68; OR increased duration = 0.46, 95%CI = 0.31-0.69). Understanding social dynamics is fundamental to predict infectious disease spread, particularly in humanitarian settings. More evidence is needed to understand behaviors influencing disease dynamics and drivers of behaviors, including trust in authorities, social, and economic factors. Peace, community engagement, and reduction of misinformation remain critical for epidemic responses in humanitarian settings.",

A lack of data on the burden of RSV infections and the impact on health systems in resource-limited settings hinders evidence-based policy decisions. Here, we aimed to assess RSV's burden on the health system in Bangladesh. From January to December, 2019, we conducted a prospective study at Bangladesh's largest paediatric hospital among children aged 0-59 months admitted with a possible respiratory infection, as guided by the WHO RSV hospital-based surveillance case definition. Outcomes for RSV-positive children younger than 5 years were analysed. We also followed up outcomes of children denied hospitalisation due to bed shortages. Adjusted hazard ratios for children denied admission versus admitted were estimated using survival analysis. Monte Carlo simulations with a queueing model were used to estimate the effects of RSV prefusion F maternal vaccine or nirsevimab on admission denials and mortality. Of 40 664 children admitted, 31 692 were younger than 5 years; 19 940 were in study wards. Among 7191 admitted with possible respiratory infections, 6149 (85·5%) had nasopharyngeal swabs taken, with 1261 (20·5%) testing RSV-positive. The median age of children who tested positive for RSV was 3·0 months (IQR 1·0-8·0), with a median hospital stay of 5 days (IQR 4-8); 24 (1·9%) of 1261 died in hospital. 8274 (5·5%) of 151 110 bed days were for children who were positive for RSV. Additionally, of 9169 children denied admission, outcomes were tracked for 3928 and compared with 2845 admitted. The hazard ratio for death was 1·56 (95% CI 1·34 to 1·81) for children denied versus admitted, being highest for neonates at 2·27 (1·87 to 2·75). RSV prefusion F maternal vaccine or nirsevimab could have reduced denials by 677 (95% prediction interval 63 to 1347) and 1289 (684 to 1865), respectively, potentially preventing 130 (-60 to 322) and 258 (32 to 469) deaths.

The main outcome was the proportion of deceased neonates who received guideline-adherent treatments before they died. Mixed-effect multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with administration of at least bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation for perinatal asphyxia. Of the 1194 neonates (median [IQR] age at the time of death, 2 [1-6] days; 692 males [58.0%]) who died and were enrolled in CHAMPS with available clinical data, 476 (39.9%) died from perinatal asphyxia, 562 (47.0%) died from neonatal sepsis, and 156 (13.1%) from both conditions. These neonates had a median (IQR) birth weight of 2130 (1266-2988) g. For cases with perinatal asphyxia, guideline adherence ranged from 12.2% (n = 77) for adrenaline administration to 85.4% (540) for supplemental oxygen administration. Only 4.4% of neonates (28) with perinatal asphyxia received all recommended treatments. Among cases with neonatal sepsis, antibiotics were administered to 86.8% (623), although the recommended treatment was administered to only 61.0% (438). In multivariable analyses, neonates in whom clinicians accurately identified perinatal asphyxia were more likely to receive BVM ventilation than those who had received discordant antemortem and postmortem diagnoses (adjusted odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.29-3.12). In this cross-sectional study, clinical care guideline adherence was suboptimal among neonates who died from perinatal asphyxia or neonatal sepsis. This finding underscores the critical need to increase adherence in regions with high rates of neonatal mortality and may inform strategies for strengthening health systems to support compliance with clinical care guidelines.",

        "abstract": "Ancylostoma duodenale, a parasitic nematode worm, is found to be involved in various infections, including intestinal blood loss, protein malnutrition, and anemia. Antimicrobial resistance to the available therapeutics has prompted the search for new drug and vaccine targets against A. duodenale. Despite significant advances in vaccine development against A. duodenale, no commercial and FDA-approved vaccine exists to safeguard humans from infections caused by this pathogen. In this investigation, a stringent bioinformatics analysis identified 36 unique essential and host-interacting proteins. Based on their subcellular localization, 6 proteins located in the extracellular space and outer membrane were categorized as vaccine targets, while the remaining proteins were predicted to act as potential drug candidates. These vaccine candidates were further assessed for antigenicity, allergenicity, and physicochemical analysis to determine their suitability for the designing of a multi-epitope vaccine. Two candidate proteins were chosen as optimal targets in the development of vaccine design. The identified T- and B-cell epitopes from these proteins were then combined with appropriate linkers and adjuvants to design chimeric vaccine constructs aimed at inducing both cellular and humoral immune responses. Molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations, PCA analysis, DCCM analysis, and binding free energy calculations proved stable interactions of the designed vaccine with human immune cell receptors. Within a bacterial cloning system, the vaccine constructs demonstrated the ability to be cloned and expressed. The immunological stimulation elicited significant immunological responses to the proposed vaccine. Our investigation identified new therapeutic targets and developed a peptide-based multi-epitope vaccine against A. duodenale infection. Additional experimental verification will open up new therapeutic alternatives for this emerging resistant pathogen.",

Chronic conditions increasingly strain health systems, which are often unprepared for these demands. This study examines the burden of conditions requiring acute versus chronic care, including sequelae. Conditions and sequelae from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 were classified into acute or chronic care categories. Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae.

We conducted an active prospective case ascertainment of children with cerebral palsy (CP) attending the National Children's Hospital in Hanoi between June to November 2017, following the model proposed by the Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance system in Australia. All children were assessed by trained paediatricians at the hospital and their immunization history was recorded. Data were collected from 765 children with CP (median age = 1.7 years, IQR = 2.7 years). Of these children, 82.7% were fully immunized for their age (compared to 96.4% of the general child population) according to the Vietnamese Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) schedule. A BCG vaccination scar was present in 94.0% of children with CP, and 95.9% of eligible children had received the measles-rubella vaccine as part of the national campaign (compared with 96.0% and 98.2% of the general population respectively). Incomplete vaccination according to the EPI was associated with younger age, living in an earth/sand house, homebirth, low-level maternal education, being diagnosed with CP before the age of three, having bilateral CP, having associated impairments (i.e., epilepsy, intellectual, visual, speech), being at level IV-V on the Gross Motor Function Classification System, and being undernutrition. This is the first study to document the immunization status of children with CP in Vietnam. A large proportion had not received the measles-rubella vaccine and 17.3% were not fully immunized. To increase vaccination coverage, interventions and strategies are required to ensure that all children with CP have equitable access to early diagnosis, immunization, health education programs, outreach programs, and frequent follow-up. Early diagnosis and focused intervention in early life could further improve vaccination coverage in children with CP.",

        "abstract": "Digital platforms like social media are increasingly used to promote vaccine uptake in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet limited evidence exists on their economic value. This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of a behavioral insights-informed social media campaign designed to increase HPV vaccine uptake among adolescent girls ages 9-14 in Bangladesh. A static cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the health system perspective. Inputs included campaign delivery costs, vaccine procurement and distribution, and treatment costs averted through cervical cancer prevention. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted per vaccinated girl were modeled using global burden-of-disease parameters. Effectiveness estimates were drawn from a quasi-experimental evaluation of the campaign, which reported a 9.5 percentage-point increase in vaccine uptake in one study arm and a 5.3 percentage-point increase in another, relative to a control group. These findings were preceded by a posttest study in Dhaka Division, which showed a strong association between campaign exposure and vaccination behavior. The incremental cost per vaccinated girl was $6.02, and the cost per DALY averted - i.e. the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) - was $39.57. This falls well below established cost-effectiveness thresholds, including 40% of GDP per capita, commonly applied in LMICs. The findings suggest that digital campaigns guided by behavioral insights can represent a highly cost-effective approach to addressing persistent immunization coverage gaps. These results support the integration of such strategies into national immunization programs, particularly in contexts where traditional outreach methods may face financial constraints.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial lysate proteins (BLPs) serve as potential immunostimulants, recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on immune cells, eliciting a robust immune response. In this study, THP-1 macrophages were treated with varying doses of BLPs derived from <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> (SP), <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i> (SA), and <i>Serratia marcescens</i> (SM). The results showed significant increases (<i>p</i>  < 0.05) in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-<i>α</i>, IL-1<i>β</i>, IL-6, IL-12, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), eotaxin, and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1<i>α</i>, except for 5 µg of all BLPs for TNF-<i>α</i> and eotaxin, and 5 µg of SP for IL-12 production. No significant differences were found between the corresponding doses of SP and SA or SP and SM, except for GM-CSF in all doses, while SA and SM only showed a difference at the 5 µg dose for GM-CSF. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the 10 and 20 µg doses of all BLPs, indicating that doses higher than 10 µg do not significantly enhance the pro-inflammatory response. Combination doses of SP + SM and SA + SM did not show significant differences, except for IL-1<i>β</i>, suggesting no synergistic effect. Cytotoxicity was observed to increase with higher BLP concentrations in a dose-dependent manner, with combinations of SP + SM and SA + SM exhibiting greater cytotoxicity than the individual BLPs. Proteomic analysis of BLPs identified immunostimulatory proteins, including heat shock proteins (HSPs; ClpB, DnaK, and GroEL), metabolic enzymes (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), enolase, and arginine deiminase (ADI)), and surface and secreted proteins (ESAT-6-like protein, CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9, OmpA, porin OmpC, and serralysin), which are involved in immune modulation, bacterial clearance, and immune evasion. This study underscores the potential of bacterial proteins as vaccine adjuvants or supplementary therapies; however, further research is essential to find a balance between immune activation and inflammation reduction to develop safer and more effective immunostimulants.",

The WHO's Product Development for Vaccines Advisory Committee (PDVAC) endorsed a regulatory pathway for a bivalent S.

Since the use of CHIM data in lieu of phase 3 efficacy studies and to identify markers of immune protection is not yet widely accepted by regulatory bodies, the WHO organized a consultation with vaccine developers, manufacturers, and regulators. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the feasibility and considerations for the licensure of a bivalent S. Typhi/Paratyphi A vaccine.

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer remains a major global health challenge, largely driven by persistent infections with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). Although preventive vaccines have reduced cervical cancer incidence in some settings, effective therapeutic strategies for established HPV-associated malignancies remain limited. High-risk HPV types (particularly 16 and 18) utilize their E6 oncoprotein to promote ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the tumor suppressor p53, thereby facilitating uncontrolled cell proliferation and immune evasion. Targeting E6 has thus emerged as a key strategy to counteract HPV-driven carcinogenesis. In this work, we employed a comprehensive in silico framework-encompassing density functional theory (DFT), ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profiling, molecular docking (including refinement and validation), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations-to evaluate a series of chemically modified lupenone derivatives as potential HPV oncoprotein inhibitors. Initially, lupenone was modified with different functional groups, and each derivative was screened for drug-likeness via ADMET analysis to confirm pharmacological viability. Concurrently, pharmacophore mapping highlighted key alignments between ligand functional groups and pharmacophoric sites, while DFT calculations elucidated each compound's electronic structure, conformational stability, and chemical reactivity. Subsequent docking assessments against E6 oncoprotein and molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed structural robustness in several top-performing compounds, indicating minimal conformational fluctuations over time. These findings demonstrate the potential of lupenone derivatives as promising scaffolds for anti-HPV therapy. However, in vitro and in vivo investigations are necessary to confirm their efficacy, toxicity profiles, and clinical relevance in mitigating HPV-related cervical cancer.",

ACT reinfuses enhanced immune cells like tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to combat refractory cancers, while checkpoint inhibitors (eg, PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockers) restore T-cell activity.

The current prevention and treatment options are limited and increasingly complicated by the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. This study employs reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics to design a multi-epitope subunit vaccine targeting the MPB83, ArfA, DnaK, GrpE, and LpqH proteins of <i>M. bovis</i>. The T-cell and B-cell epitopes of the candidate vaccine were predicted and evaluated for antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. The promising epitopes were then assembled into three vaccine constructs (bTBV1, bTBV2, and bTBV3) using appropriate adjuvants, pan HLA DR-binding epitope (PADRE), and linkers. The constructs were analyzed for physicochemical properties, 3D structure, cytokines induction and stability, followed by molecular docking with bovine CD molecules and toll-like receptor, TLR-9. Among the candidates, bTBV3 was chosen as one of the most promising vaccine candidates due to its high aliphatic index (67.60), lowest instability score (27.26), and a strong binding affinity. Molecular dynamics simulations and the results of interactions between the vaccine-receptor complexes (eigenvalue 2.318704e-06) show that the vaccine construct bTBV3 is stable. <i>In silico</i> immune simulation findings, such as elevated IgM levels and increased Th cell populations, suggest that the designed multi-epitope vaccine candidate bTBV3 elicits robust humoral and cellular immune responses, confirming the vaccine's potential efficacy.

        "abstract": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a significant pathogen in the worldwide swine industry. The virus shows high genetic variation coupled with a broad range of virulence in pigs. Although multiple lineages of the virus have been prevalent throughout in Korea, the characteristics of lineage-wise pathogenicity are largely unknown. Therefore, this study was designed to analyze and compare the pathogenicity of 11 representative Korean PRRSV-2 isolates selected from PRRSV-2 lineages circulating in Korea, NADC30-like, VR2332-like, and three nation-specific lineages (lineage KOR A (LKA), lineage KOR B (LKB), and lineage KOR C (LKC)), which have been continuously prevalent in the nation. Eleven groups of pigs were experimentally infected with one Korean PRRSV-2 isolate through four consecutive animal experiments. Body weight and body temperature were recorded during each 4-week challenge experiment period, and virological, serological, and histopathological tests were performed on the collected samples. The data from the animal experiments were integrated into two indicators-excretion and clinical signs-through correlation and principal component analysis (PCA). Meta-analysis was used to compare PRRSV-2 isolates using each indicator. Based on these analyses, while L1C viruses used in this study (JB15-N-P31-GB and JB15-N-PJ73-GN, similar to NADC30-like strains) exhibited low or moderate levels of excretion and clinical signs, lineage 5 (L5) or modified live vaccine (MLV)-variant strains exhibited high levels of excretion compared to other PRRSV-2 isolates. However, the L5 variants all caused mild clinical signs, except for JB15-N-PJ4-GN, which showed the 4th highest clinical sign indicator. Among the Korean lineages (LKA, LKB, and LKC), two LKB strains (GGYC45 and JB15-N-PJ10-GN) were the most virulent as they showed the highest mortality after the challenge. On the other hand, the LKA and LKC viruses displayed lower excretion indicators than L5 strains, but they had higher-ranked clinical sign indicators than low-virulence L5 MLV variants. In conclusion, PRRSV prevalent in Korea has diverse excretion and clinical characteristics, and certain lineage is highly pathogenic. These results will offer useful insights to prevent spread of PRRSV and improve the efficacy of vaccines in the future.",

        "abstract": "<i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection of the stomach's epithelial cells is a significant risk factor for stomach cancer. Various <i>H pylori</i> proteins (CagA, GGT, NapA, PatA, urease, and VacA) were targeted to design 2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, V1 and V2, using bioinformatics tools. Physicochemical parameters, secondary and tertiary structure, molecular docking and dynamic simulation, codon optimization, and RNA structure prediction have also been estimated for these developed vaccines. Physicochemical analyses revealed that these developed vaccines are soluble (GRAVY < 0), basic (pI < 7), and stable (aliphatic index < 80). The secondary and tertiary structure of the vaccines demonstrated robustness. The docking with toll-like receptors (TLRs) revealed that the vaccines have a potential affinity for TLR-2 (V1: -1132.3 kJ/mol, V2: -1093.6 kJ/mol) and TLR-4 (V1: -1042.7 kJ/mol, V2: -1201.2 kJ/mol), and molecular dynamics simulations confirmed their dynamic stability. Structural analyses of V1 (-505.96 kcal/mol) and V2 (-634.92 kcal/mol) mRNA vaccines underscored their stability. In addition, the vaccine showed a considerable rise in the counts of B cells and extended activation of both T cells was also observed for the vaccines, suggesting the potential for long-lasting immunity, and offering enhanced protection against <i>H pylori</i>. These findings not only suggest potential long-lasting immunity against <i>H pylori</i> but also offer hope for the future of stomach cancer prevention. Notably, the study emphasizes the need for subsequent animal and human-based studies to confirm these promising results.",

        "abstract": "Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) H9N2 has been enzootic in Bangladeshi poultry since 2006. H9N2 outbreaks can decrease egg production and growth and pose a risk to human health. The role of avian hosts in the persistence, evolution, and dispersion of H9N2 is poorly understood in Bangladesh. Hence, this study unveils the intricate role of major host species in virus maintenance and evolution and the temporal and seasonal patterns of H9N2 in Bangladesh from 2006 to 2023. Multinomial logistic regression analysis indicated that the circulation of H9N2 in different species and interfaces is significantly influenced by the seasons. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of H9N2 sequences in Bangladesh revealed two distinct lineages: G1 and Eurasian. The G1 lineage split into two clusters, coexisting until 2019, at which point only one cluster persisted. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis of G1 lineage unveiled frequent bidirectional viral transitions among ducks, chickens, and quails. Chickens might be a pivotal source of H9N2 in Bangladesh, with a higher number of viral transitions from chickens to ducks and quails. Quails appear to acquire most of their viral transitions from chickens rather than ducks, suggesting that quail epizootics are primarily triggered by spillover events from chickens. Our results suggest viral circulation in commercial chickens despite vaccination. The vaccination approach should be revised, assess vaccine efficacy, and extension of vaccination to backyard chickens and quails.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundIn the global scenario of public health, cervical cancer poses a major threat with high mortality rates, especially in women. New incidence cases and prevalence vary across different regions, as recently shown by GLOBOCAN data. The development of cervical cancer is primarily due to persistent infection by high-risk genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a multifaceted process that is influenced by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.PurposeThe goal of this study is to thoroughly investigate cervical cancer, including its etiology, molecular mechanisms, progression, diagnosis strategies, and current therapies. This review further highlights the transformative power of HPV vaccination and screening programs in curbing the disease's burden and potentially promising novel approaches like immunotherapy and targeted therapy.Research DesignThis is a narrative review article that summarizes previous literatures regarding cervical cancer in terms of molecular mechanism, etiology, clinical developments, and prevention.Study SampleThe review encompassed studies from diverse sources, including experimental, observational, and clinical research published between 1992 and 2025.Data Collection and/or AnalysisData were collected through comprehensive literature searches using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library with defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.ResultsNonetheless, there are gaps in research and controversies regarding vaccine coverage, screening practices, and treatment accessibility for poor populations. Precision medicine trends are emerging along with new biomarkers for early detection and personalized treatment, which also form part of this discussion. Key findings include the critical role of prevention measures in controlling the global impact of cervical cancer.ConclusionsThe paper synthesizes the existing knowledge and identifies gaps that require further research, which is significant in augmenting prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cervical cancer towards addressing its public health implications worldwide.",

        "abstract": "Escherichia coli is a powerful and cost-effective platform for producing recombinant proteins. However, E. coli- produced proteins lack side-chain glycosylation and may be misfolded due to non-native disulfide bonds, often leading to poor immunogenicity. As a result, they are commonly perceived as unsuitable for use as antiviral vaccine antigens. This study addresses this challenge using the small 12 kDa envelope protein domain III of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV-EDIII) as a model. We demonstrate that the low immunogenicity of E. coli- produced proteins can be effectively overcome by employing a solubility-controlling peptide tag (SCP-tag) composed of five isoleucines (C5I). E. coli-produced JEV-EDIII oligomerized into 100 nm (Rh) soluble oligomers upon attachment of the C5I-tag, whereas the untagged JEV-EDIII remained monomeric (Rh ∼ 1.9 nm). The C5I-tag significantly enhanced anti-JEV EDIII IgG titers, as evidenced by ELISA, and increased the population of memory T cells in the spleen, as assessed by flow cytometry. Most notably, the C5I-tagged JEV-EDIII elicited neutralizing antibodies, confirmed by the FRNT<sub>50</sub> neutralization assay using live JEV. These findings suggest that oligomerization via SCP-tagging offers a promising, adjuvant-free approach for producing neutralizing antibodies with long-term T cell memory, paving the way for developing E. coli- produced, protein domain-based vaccines.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives:</b> The development of an effective HIV vaccine has faced persistent challenges, as evidenced by the recent discontinuation of the Mosaico phase 3 trial. This study aims to critically examine the obstacles encountered in HIV vaccine development, with a focus on the Mosaico trial, which tested the Ad26.Mos4.HIV vaccine among 3,900 participants across multiple countries. We also explore emerging vaccine technologies and their potential in overcoming these challenges, while reflecting on lessons from previous trials to inform future strategies. <b>Methods:</b> We reviewed the Mosaico trial's approach, which involved testing the efficacy of the Ad26.Mos4.HIV vaccine. We compared the outcomes of the Mosaico trial with other major HIV vaccine trials, including HVTN 702, Imbokodo, and RV144. We explored the limitations of the immune responses elicited by the Mosaico vaccine. The review focused on the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) and the challenges related to antigenic diversity and B-cell engagement. Emerging vaccine technologies, such as virus-like particles (VLPs), nanoparticles, SOSIP trimers, and mRNA platforms, were also analysed for their scalability, immune durability, and potential to advance HIV vaccine development. <b>Results:</b> The Mosaico trial was discontinued due to insufficient efficacy in reducing HIV acquisition, primarily due to the inability of the vaccine to induce bNAbs, which are crucial for targeting the diverse HIV-1 strains. A major challenge was the inadequate engagement of germline B-cell precursors, compounded by the antigenic diversity of the virus. The analysis showed that emerging vaccine platforms, such as VLPs, nanoparticles, SOSIP trimers, and mRNA-based approaches, hold promise but present challenges related to scalability and the durability of immune responses. The role of T cells and adjuvants in enhancing vaccine efficacy was also highlighted as critical for integrating both humoral and cellular immunity. <b>Conclusions:</b> The Mosaico trial, as well as other major HIV vaccine trials, underscores the need for a multi-pronged approach that incorporates both antibody and T-cell responses to tackle the complexities of HIV-1. Future efforts in HIV vaccine development must focus on inducing bNAbs, generating robust T-cell responses, and utilizing scalable vaccine platforms. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into vaccine design offers new opportunities to optimize immunogenic targets, which could significantly improve the potential for durable and broad immune protection. The development of a successful HIV vaccine by 2030 is achievable but relies on leverage on advanced technologies including artificial intelligence, innovation and insights from past trial data.",

        "abstract": "To comprehensively compare the disease burden among patients with RA, PsA and AS using Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scores and to identify distinct patient clusters based on comorbidity profiles and PROMIS outcomes. Data from the global COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases (COVAD) 2 e-survey were analysed. Patients with RA, PsA or AS undergoing treatment with DMARDs were included. PROMIS scores (global physical health, global mental health, fatigue 4a and physical function short form 10a), comorbidities and other variables were compared among the three groups, stratified by disease activity status. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering with eXtreme Gradient Boosting feature importance analysis was performed to identify patient subgroups based on comorbidity profiles and PROMIS outcomes. The study included 2561 patients (1907 RA, 311 PsA, 343 AS). After adjusting for demographic factors, no significant differences in PROMIS scores were observed among the three groups, regardless of disease activity status. Clustering analysis identified four distinct patient groups: low burden, comorbid PsA/AS, low burden with depression and high-burden RA. Feature importance analysis revealed PROMIS global physical health as the strongest determinant of cluster assignment, followed by depression and diagnosis. The comorbid PsA/AS and high-burden RA clusters showed a higher prevalence of comorbidities (56.47% and 69.7%, respectively) and depression (41.18% and 41.67%, respectively), along with poorer PROMIS outcomes. Disease burden in inflammatory arthritis is determined by a complex interplay of factors, with physical health status and depression playing crucial roles. The identification of distinct patient clusters suggests the need for a paradigm shift towards more integrated care approaches that equally emphasize physical and mental health, regardless of the underlying diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Typhoid fever remains a substantial public health challenge in low-income and middle-income countries. By 2023, typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) had been introduced in six countries globally, with more than 50 million doses distributed. Now that TCVs are being deployed, there is a need for observational studies to assess vaccine effectiveness in the field. We aimed to evaluate the validity of different observational study designs in estimating vaccine protection. We compared different observational and experimental study designs for assessing vaccine effectiveness by re-analysing data from the TyVAC Bangladesh trial, a participant-blinded and observer-blinded cluster-randomised controlled trial done in Mirpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh. 150 geographical clusters were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either TCV or Japanese encephalitis vaccine. Eligible children aged 9 months to 15 years were offered a single dose of the vaccine randomly assigned to their cluster of residence, and baseline vaccination was done between April 15 and May 15, 2018. We compared estimates of vaccine effectiveness from the cluster-randomised controlled trial analysis-which assessed the risk of blood-culture-confirmed typhoid fever among recipients of TCV versus recipients of Japanese encephalitis vaccine-with estimates from cohort study and test-negative case-control study design (TND) analyses, which compared recipients of TCV with non-vaccinees in the 75 geographical clusters where TCV was administered. We further conducted negative-control exposure (NCE) and negative-control outcome (NCO) analyses as bias indicators. 41 344 (67%) of 62 025 age-eligible children in the study area received the TCV or Japanese encephalitis vaccine during the baseline vaccination campaign. Among the 62 025 age-eligible children, 5582 blood-culture specimens were collected by passive surveillance, including 2546 (46%) specimens from the 75 TCV clusters. The estimated vaccine efficacy was 89% (95% CI 81-93) in the cluster-randomised controlled trial analysis, 79% (70-86) by the cohort design, 88% (79-93) by the TND when pan-negatives were used as test-negative controls, and 90% (75-96) by the TND when specimens positive for pathogens other than Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi were used as test-negative controls. Using NCE analysis, Japanese encephalitis vaccination was associated with an increased risk of typhoid fever compared with non-vaccinees in the 75 Japanese encephalitis clusters in the cohort design (incidence rate ratio 1·98 [95% CI 1·56-2·52]), but no significant association between Japanese encephalitis vaccination and typhoid fever was found with the TND. Similarly, an increased risk of non-typhoid infections was observed in the cohort NCO analyses when comparing vaccinees with non-vaccinees in both Japanese encephalitis vaccine clusters and TCV clusters, but not in the TND NCO analyses. Our findings suggests that the TND provides reliable estimates of TCV effectiveness, whereas the cohort design can bias vaccine effectiveness estimates, possibly due to unmeasured confounding effects, such as health-care-seeking behaviours. NCE and NCO approaches are useful tools for identifying such biases. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

Limited information is available on how cellular immunity is modulated by COVID-19 vaccination and prior infection, and whether it is differentially modulated in children compared to adults. Here, we aimed to compare COVID-19 vaccine-induced functional T cell response between adults and children with and without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Adults (18-45 years; n = 45) and children (5-10 years; n = 51;), who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine or remained unvaccinated, and previously infected or not with SARS-CoV-2 were selected from two cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies conducted in Bangladesh. Plasma nucleocapsid (N)-specific antibodies were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay; IFN-γ, perforin and granzyme B secreting T cells were assessed using ELISpot assay. Vaccination in adults without previous infection, induced higher frequencies of IFN-γ and granzyme B secreting T lymphocytes compared to unvaccinated adults, while it increased only IFN-γ expression in vaccinated children. Previous infection increased IFN-γ response in unvaccinated adults only. Unvaccinated children showed higher granzyme B expression compared to adults irrespective of infection status. In vaccinated individuals, prior infection induced perforin expression in both adults and children. Children showed slightly different functional T cell response than adults in response to COVID-19 vaccination and infection. mRNA vaccination provided higher IFN-γ response in both adults and children, but induced cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in adults only.

The model formulation considers transmissions through contaminated food and human-to-human contacts. It also incorporates the potential virus transmission through contact with a deceased body infected with NiV. Initially, the NiV model is assessed theoretically, identifying three distinct equilibrium states: the NiV-endemic equilibrium state, the NiV-free equilibrium state, and the equilibrium state involving infected flying foxes. Furthermore, the stability results of the model in the case of constant controls are thoroughly analyzed at the NiV-free equilibrium. Some of the parameters of the model are estimated based on the infected cases documented in Bangladesh from 2001 to 2017. We further perform sensitivity analysis to determine the most influential parameters and formulate effective time-dependent controls. Numerical simulations indicate the optimal course of action for eradicating the disease and provide a comparative analysis of controlling the infection under constant and time-varying interventions. The simulation confirms that the implementation of time-varying interventions is effective in minimizing disease incidence.",

From October 2020 to September 2022, we conducted prospective clinical surveillance and retrospective laboratory surveillance at health facilities in Dhaka, Bangladesh; Kathmandu and Kavrepalanchok, Nepal; and Karachi, Pakistan. Patients were eligible if they were outpatients with three or more days of fever in the last week. In Nepal and Pakistan, inpatients were eligible if they had suspected or confirmed enteric fever; in Bangladesh, only inpatients with confirmed enteric fever were enrolled. Patients with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever identified by hospital laboratories and laboratory network sites were also enrolled. Patients completed interviews and medical records were reviewed and abstracted. All enrolled patients had blood cultures performed. Antibiograms were performed to characterize drug sensitivity. We summarized the data descriptively. A total of 17,593 patients were enrolled from 19 facilities. Of these, 8410 patients had culture-confirmed enteric fever. Case counts in all countries decreased in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, but increased over time in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Case counts remained low throughout the study period in Nepal. In all countries, typhoid was more common than paratyphoid; the proportion of paratyphoid cases ranged from 8.4% in Pakistan to 16% in Nepal. Extensively drug-resistant typhoid was common in Pakistan (69%), but was not detected in Bangladesh or Nepal. Cases of enteric fever decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, though it is not clear how much of this decrease relates to true changes in transmission versus health-seeking behavior.

        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, dengue fever and influenza pose serious public health risks due to their high rates of morbidity and fatality. Frequent outbreaks have been caused by dengue, a virus spread by mosquitoes that causes flu-like symptoms, particularly during the monsoon season. Another infectious respiratory illness that varies every year is influenza. Both illnesses frequently co-circulate in tropical areas like Bangladesh, raising the possibility of co-infection and putting vulnerable groups at higher risk. The purpose of the article is to explore the effects of dengue and influenza co-infection in Bangladesh, looking at present issues and possible solutions to this dual health burden. This perspective piece gathers data from authoritative sources, including PubMed, the World Health Organization, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Bangladesh, and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Relevant literature on dengue and influenza incidence, control measures, and co-infection dynamics was reviewed. In Bangladesh, dengue incidence are still on the rise, while influenza infections have climbed, especially during the winter. The country's healthcare system may be overburdened by the simultaneous spread of both diseases, particularly if dengue rates keep rising and influenza cases rise. To lessen the effects of these illnesses, effective community awareness campaigns, vector control initiatives, and early diagnosis techniques are crucial. Bangladesh must emphasize increased preventative and preparation measures, such as better monitoring, public health communication, and vaccine development research, given the twin danger posed by dengue and influenza. To lower the likelihood of co-infection and avert future public health emergencies, coordinated actions are essential.",

        "abstract": "Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines elicit immunological responses. However, it is difficult to distinguish responses generated after vaccination versus natural infection. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid-specific IgG and RBD specific IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4) responses using ELISA in four different groups; (1) COVID-19 patients (n=39) with varying disease severity and (2) COVID-19 vaccinated individuals (n=24, both adenovirus/mRNA based) (3) vaccinated after infection (n=39) and (4) patients experienced breakthrough infection (n=14), in Bangladesh. Both COVID-19 patients and vaccinees developed robust RBD-specific IgG responses. In contrast, nucleocapsid specific IgG responses were found in patients but not in vaccine recipients. A distinct IgG subclass antibody response was observed in COVID-19 patients compared to COVID-19-vaccinated individuals. Specifically, COVID-19 patients exhibited elevated levels of both IgG1 and IgG3, with IgG3 dominating in the early phase of infection (days 1-7) followed by a subsequent increase in IgG1. Conversely, COVID-19 vaccination predominantly induced IgG1 responses without a concurrent rise in IgG3. This effect was more evident when a significant rise of IgG1 but not IgG3 was observed in patients who received COVID-19 vaccines after 90 days of infection. However, following breakthrough infection, we observed an increase in both IgG1 and IgG3. All of these findings collectively indicate that COVID-19 vaccination predominantly induces IgG1, whereas natural infection can elicit responses in both IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. The findings highlight RBD-specific IgG3 as well as nucleocapsid IgG as crucial markers for differentiating between vaccination and natural infection and suggest these assays have utility for longitudinal monitoring of vaccinations and for establishing SARS-CoV-2 correlates of protection.",

        "abstract": "The burden of childhood diarrhoea remains one of the most important public health problems in countries like Bangladesh, which can be reduced by effective preventive measures. We aimed to investigate the trends in preventive measures practised among under five children with diarrhoea over the last 12 years. Data was extracted from the Diarrhoeal Disease Surveillance System at Dhaka Hospital for the period 2012-2023. STATA 15 was used for analysis. We used the Joncheere-Terpstra trend test to examine the trend in preventive measures against diarrhoea and the slope index of inequality (SII) to determine their association with the wealth index. Among 20 373 participants, 61.0% were male, with a median (IQR) age of 11 months (8.0-16.0). Most (88.3%) had access to sanitary latrines, and 40.3% of households consumed boiled or filtered water. We found that 50.3% children aged 6-59 months received vitamin A, and 88.4% of children >9 months had measles vaccination. Breastfeeding practices were observed in 17.8% of the children. Significant upward trends were observed for sanitary latrine use and measles vaccination (p<0.001). Receiving vitamin A supplementation and boiled/filtered water consumption showed a declining trend (p<0.001). Parental education and maternal media exposure were found to be significantly associated with the preventive measures (p<0.05). The wealth index showed a significant association with vitamin A supplementation (p<0.01). However, SII does not indicate inequality between the groups. We found that children from wealthier quintile families had a significantly higher rate of measles immunisation, as indicated by the SII (p value=0.039). Improving practices of preventive measures can significantly reduce diarrhoeal diseases among children under five. Emphasis should be placed on vitamin A supplementation and the consumption of boiled or filtered water. A targeted approach is essential, including promoting health education, enhancing health awareness, and increasing media exposure for mothers.",

        "abstract": "With the ability to cause massive epidemics that have consequences on millions of individuals globally, the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) emerges as a severe menace. Developing an effective vaccine is urgent as no effective therapeutics are available for such viral infections. Therefore, we designed a novel mRNA vaccine against CHIKV with a combination of highly antigenic and potential MHC-I, MHC-II, and B-cell epitopes from the structural polyprotein. The vaccine demonstrated well-characterized physicochemical properties, indicating its solubility and potential functional stability within the body (GRAVY score of -0.639). Structural analyses of the vaccine revealed a well-stabilized secondary and tertiary structure (Ramachandran score of 82.8% and a Z-score of -4.17). Docking studies of the vaccine with TLR-2 (-1027.7 KJ/mol) and TLR-4 (-1212.4 KJ/mol) exhibited significant affinity with detailed hydrogen bond interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations highlighted distinct conformational dynamics among the vaccine, \"vaccine-TLR-2\" and \"vaccine-TLR-4\" complexes. The vaccine's ability to elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses, including the presence of memory B-cells and T-cells, persistent B-cell immunity for a year, and the activation of TH cells leading to the release of IFN-γ and IL-2, has significant implications for its potential effectiveness. The CHIKV vaccine developed in this study shows promise as a potential candidate for future vaccine production against CHIKV, suggesting its suitability for further clinical advancement, including in vitro and in vivo experiments.",

        "abstract": "The first dose of measles-rubella (MR) vaccine is routinely administered to infants aged 9 months as part of a standard two-dose schedule. However, during large measles outbreaks and in other settings of increased circulation or increased risk, WHO recommends administering a supplementary dose at age 6 months to protect young infants. We aimed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a first dose of MR vaccine administered to infants aged 6 months and its effect on the immune response to the routine MR vaccine at age 9 months. This open-label, randomised trial enrolled healthy infants aged 6 months in Matlab, Bangladesh, who had never received an MR vaccine dose and had no history of measles or rubella. Using a computer-generated block randomisation scheme, infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either two doses of the MR vaccine, one at age 6 months and the second at age 9 months (two-dose group), or one dose at age 9 months (one-dose group). Baseline characteristics were recorded for all enrolled participants at age 6 months. Blood samples were drawn for antibody assays before each vaccination and at final follow up when infants were aged 11 months. The primary outcome was immunogenicity of a first MR vaccine in infants aged 6 months or 9 months and the immunogenicity of a second MR vaccine in infants aged 9 months who received their first MR vaccine at 6 months. Immunogenicity was measured as the proportion of infants who seroconverted in the 12 weeks after vaccination at age 6 months or the 8 weeks after vaccination at age 9 months. Seroconversion was defined as a 4-times increase in IgG concentrations relative to the pre-vaccination concentrations or achieving seroprotective antibody concentrations between study timepoints. The modified intention-to-treat analysis included all infants who received MR vaccines per group assignment and had antibody results at baseline, 9 months, and 11 months. All enrolled infants were included in the safety analysis of the immediate reactions (observed by study staff at the fixed-site clinic in the first 30 min after vaccination), adverse events within 48 h of vaccination among infants in the two-dose group receiving their first MR vaccine at age 6 months, and adverse events observed by study staff or parents at any time during the study. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03071575, and is closed to enrolment. Between March 9, 2017, and March 18, 2018, 620 infants were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two study groups (312 in the two-dose group and 308 in the one-dose group). Of the 301 infants vaccinated at 6 months, 282 seroconverted for measles (94%, 95% CI 90-96), and 283 seroconverted for rubella (94%, 91-96). By 11 months, after receiving a second dose at age 9 months, 297 (cumulative 99%, 95% CI 97-100) infants seroconverted for measles and 297 infants seroconverted for rubella (cumulative 99%, 96-100). Of the 292 infants vaccinated at 9 months only, 291 seroconverted for both antigens by age 11 months (100%, 95% CI 98-100). 123 adverse events were observed; 72 in the two-dose group and 51 in the one-dose group, with no differences in severity (p=0·78) or outcomes (p=0·71) by study group. 12 (17%) events in the two-dose group and seven (14%) in the one-dose group were severe; most events were mild, resolved without sequelae, and were unrelated to the MR vaccine. One death occurred in the one-dose group before the infant received the 9-month dose of the vaccine, and therefore was deemed to be unrelated to the MR vaccine. The data presented support use of MR vaccine at 6 months to protect young infants during measles outbreaks and in settings with increased risk or high transmission. We recommend additional studies to evaluate longer-term immunity based on age at vaccination. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

        "abstract": "Declared as one of the ten most pressing threats to global health in 2019, the complexity around vaccine acceptance and hesitancy has once again gained great momentum following the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of vaccine acceptance may endanger the mission of improving vaccine uptake globally to tackle pandemics, reduce morbidity and mortality of preventable diseases and to prevent antibiotic resistance worldwide. Countries of the global south, including South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries are especially affected by the dangers of low vaccination uptake and continue to show decreases in coverage in recent years. This paper examines factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy in south Asia and the extent to which they are context and disease specific, guided by a modified version of the WHO SAGE 5 C model by Razai et al. Three databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles by using a comprehensive search strategy. Results from 44 quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method studies were included in the systematic review and appraised for quality, thematically analyzed and mapped onto the 5 C model. findings from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Afghanistan showed vaccine hesitancy to be context and vaccine-specific within different settings of the countries. The main factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy can be identified as narrow confidence in vaccines, miscommunication, and lack of knowledge embedded into overarching constraints and contexts. To tackle vaccine hesitancy in SAARC countries, interventions need to be co-created by communities and mutual trust needs to be ensured, for instance through increased equity in knowledge distribution.",

        "abstract": "Mass oral cholera vaccination campaigns targeted at subnational areas with high incidence are central to global cholera elimination efforts. Serological surveillance offers a complementary approach to address gaps in clinical surveillance in these regions. However, similar immune responses from vaccination and infection can lead to overestimates of incidence of infection. To address this, we analyzed antibody dynamics in infected and vaccinated individuals to refine seroincidence estimation strategies for partially vaccinated populations. We tested 757 longitudinal serum samples from confirmed <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> O1 cases and uninfected contacts in Bangladesh as well as vaccinees from Bangladesh and Haiti, using a multiplex bead assay to measure IgG, IgM, and IgA binding to five cholera-specific antigens. Infection elicited stronger and broader antibody responses than vaccination, with rises in cholera toxin B-subunit (CTB) and toxin-coregulated pilus A (TcpA) antibodies uniquely associated with infection. Previously proposed random forest models frequently misclassified vaccinated individuals as recently infected (over 20% at some time points) during the first four months post-vaccination. To address this, we developed new random forest models incorporating vaccinee data, which kept false positive rates among vaccinated (1%) and unvaccinated (4%) individuals low without a significant loss in sensitivity. Simulated serosurveys demonstrated that unbiased seroincidence estimates could be achieved within 21 days of vaccination campaigns by ascertaining vaccination status of participants or applying updated models. These approaches to overcome biases in serological surveillance enable reliable seroincidence estimation even in areas with recent vaccination campaigns enhancing the utility of serological surveillance as an epidemiologic tool in moderate-to-high cholera incidence settings.",

This study used immunoinformatics and reverse vaccinology to design a potential mRNA vaccine targeting <i>Shigella</i> pathotypes out of 4071 proteins from <i>Shigella sonnei</i> str. Ss046, 4 key antigenic candidates were identified: putative outer membrane protein (Q3YZL0), PapC-like porin protein (Q3YZM5), putative fimbrial-like protein (Q3Z3I2), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-assembly protein LptD (Q3Z5V5), ensuring broad pathotype coverage. A multitope vaccine was designed incorporating cytotoxic T lymphocyte, helper T lymphocyte, and B-cell epitopes, linked with suitable linkers and adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity. Computational analyses predicted vaccine's favorable antigenicity, solubility, and stability, while molecular docking and dynamic simulations demonstrated strong binding affinity and stability with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), indicating potential for robust immune activation. Immune simulations predicted strong humoral and cellular immune responses, characterized by significant cytokine production and long-term immune memory. Structural evaluations of the complex, including radius of gyration, root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, and solvent accessibility, confirmed the vaccine's structural integrity, and stability under physiological conditions.

        "abstract": "Shigellosis is a leading cause of diarrhoea in children globally. We aimed to assess the burden of specific Shigella species and Shigella flexneri serotypes, characterise their clinical syndromes and natural immunity, and evaluate their relevance as causes of diarrhoea and linear growth faltering. In the MAL-ED birth cohort study, children younger than 17 days were enrolled from Nov 3, 2009, to Feb 29, 2012, in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, Tanzania, and South Africa and were followed up for 2 years. In this retrospective substudy, we retested Shigella quantitative PCR-positive diarrhoeal and non-diarrhoeal stool samples with molecular subtyping assays. We estimated the prevalence of specific Shigella species and serotypes, estimated their associations with diarrhoea and clinical characteristics using generalised linear mixed models, estimated their associations with linear growth using linear regression, and used longitudinal infection data to estimate protection due to previous infection using the Andersen and Gill extension of the Cox model. 1715 children (874 [51·0%] male and 841 [49·0%] female) with complete follow-up to 2 years provided 45 835 stool samples collected between age 0 and 2 years. 1294 (75·5%) children had at least one Shigella detection in a non-diarrhoeal or asymptomatic stool and 507 (29·6%) had at least one Shigella-attributed diarrhoea episode. In this substudy, we were able to type 1202 samples. The most common species and serotypes were Shigella sonnei (366 [30·4%] of 1202), S flexneri 2a (250 [20·8%]), and S flexneri 6 (296 [24·6%]). The associations of S flexneri and S sonnei detection with diarrhoea versus asymptomatic control stools were similar. Compared with diarrhoea episodes attributable to S flexneri, those attributable to S sonnei were less likely to be bloody (prevalence ratio 0·36 [95% CI 0·23 to 0·56]) or severe (prevalence ratio 0·58 [0·35 to 0·96]). The associations between asymptomatic Shigella infections and impaired linear growth at age 2 years were stronger for S flexneri than S sonnei (S flexneri length-for-age Z score difference -0·18 [95% CI -0·29 to -0·07] and S sonnei length-for-age Z score difference -0·07 [-0·21 to 0·07]). Examination of longitudinal infections showed that previous S sonnei infection was associated with a lower hazard of subsequent S sonnei diarrhoea (calibrated hazard ratio 0·41 [95% CI 0·19 to 0·90]). Otherwise, evidence for homotypic or heterotypic natural immunity was not apparent. This study provides data on prevailing Shigella species and serotypes in settings with a high burden of disease, underscoring the importance of asymptomatic S flexneri infection on growth impairment and the severity of S flexneri diarrhoea. Upcoming Shigella vaccines might need to induce immune responses that improve upon those produced by natural infection. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

Vaccination against Hepatitis B is an effective means of prevention. However, studies have reported variable vaccination rates among medical students from different regions of South Asia. Understanding vaccination rates and barriers can guide effective interventions to protect future doctors. Therefore, we aimed to find out the vaccination rate among medical students in South Asia. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases (PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and other sources) beginning from inception to July 15, 2024. Observational studies reporting vaccination rates among Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.) students in South Asia were included. Two reviewers independently screened and performed the quality assessment. Pooled vaccination rates were calculated and visualized using a random-effects model in R Studio (Version 2023.12.0). Subgroup analysis was performed based on country and year of publication of the studies. Fifty studies from the South Asian region, including 12,231 participants, were included in the quantitative analysis. The overall pooled Hepatitis B vaccination rate using the random-effects model was 56% (CI: 49-63%), with significant heterogeneity among the included studies (I2 = 98%; P = 0). Subgroup analysis based on country revealed a significant regional variation in vaccination rate (59% in Pakistan, 57% in India, 55% in Nepal, and 41% in Bangladesh; P < 0.01). Lack of awareness, perceived low risk or necessity, concerns about side effects, logistical challenges, and lack of motivation have been reported as barriers to vaccination. The overall vaccination rate was relatively low in South Asia, with significant regional variation. Based on the reported barriers, we recommend that relevant authorities focus on vaccination awareness, motivation, cost-effectiveness, logistics management, policy formulation, and monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer ranks as the common prevalent cancer, among women worldwide especially impacting low-resource countries. In Bangladesh, this accounts for 12 % of all cancer cases. The development of cancer is closely linked to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Despite the availability of HPV vaccines, their uptake remains limited in Bangladesh. Thus, this research aims to assess the knowledge and willingness of parents and school teachers regarding HPV vaccination for eligible girls in Bangladesh. This study involved 406 parents and school teachers of girls aged 9-14 years from Dhaka city. A cross-sectional study design was used. Data collection was done through a questionnaire administered by interviewers after pre-testing and refinement for clarity and reliability. Analysis was carried out using Stata 17 software. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to uncover associations and predictors related to knowledge levels and willingness. Findings revealed that a majority of participants (64.04 %) exhibited an understanding of HPV and cervical cancer yet a high percentage (98.28 %) expressed willingness to engage in HPV vaccination initiatives. participants with primary (AOR = 3.306, p < 0.005), secondary (AOR = 8.806, p < 0.001), and higher education (AOR = 5.059, p < 0.001), as well as those from upper-middle-income groups (AOR = 3.038, p < 0.001), had significantly higher knowledge of HPV and cervical cancer. The research emphasizes lack of knowledge regarding HPV and its vaccination among parents and educators in Bangladesh despite a willingness to vaccinate. These results emphasize the importance of tailored initiatives and better access, to health information to increase HPV vaccine acceptance and lower the incidence of cervical cancer.",

        "title": "Immunogenicity and safety of an Escherichia coli-produced bivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (Cecolin) in girls aged 9-14 years in Ghana and Bangladesh: a randomised, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.",
        "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been available for nearly 20 years. However, the overall coverage of girls aged 15 years and younger is low, especially in low-resource settings, where the burden of cervical cancer is highest. Increasing access and facilitating implementation of HPV vaccination will contribute to cervical cancer elimination efforts. To generate data in different dosing regimens and in low-resource settings, we aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of various schedules of an Escherichia coli-expressed bivalent HPV vaccine (2vHPV) compared with a widely used quadrivalent vaccine. This randomised, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial enrolled healthy girls aged 9-14 years from single sites in Ghana and Bangladesh. Participants were randomly assigned via interactive web response system technology equally into five study groups, stratified by site: two doses of 2vHPV, the first at baseline and the second 6, 12, or 24 months later; a quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV) at baseline followed 24 months later by 2vHPV; or two doses of 4vHPV given 6 months apart (referent). We tested for antigen-specific (HPV-16 and HPV-18) binding antibodies by ELISA at baseline and before and 1 month after the second dose. The primary objective was to show immunological non-inferiority of the 2vHPV vaccine schedules to the referent 1 month after the second dose in the per-protocol population, with a non-inferiority margin of 0·5 for the lower bound of the 98·3% CI for the geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratio. Adverse events and serious adverse events were evaluated as secondary endpoints in the total vaccinated population. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04508309) and is completed. Between March 15 and Nov 18, 2021, 1025 girls were enrolled and received 2vHPV at baseline and 6 months (n=205), 12 months (n=206), or 24 months (n=204); 4vHPV at baseline and 6 months (n=205); or 4vHPV at baseline and 2vHPV at 24 months (n=205). 96-99% of participants across groups were included in the per-protocol analysis. 1 month after the second dose, 2vHPV non-inferiority was shown, with GMC ratios between 1·1 and 2·4 (lower bound of the 98·3% CI of the GMC ratio between 0·9 and 1·9) for HPV-16, and between 1·3 and 1·7 (1·0 and 1·4) for HPV-18. As an exploratory objective, we assessed 2vHPV immunogenicity after one dose, finding that it was similar to that of 4vHPV up to 24 months, with GMC ratios at 24 months of 1·1 (95% CI 0·9-1·4) for HPV-16 and 1·4 (1·1-1·7) for HPV-18. The frequency of adverse events was similar across study groups, with no related unsolicited events reported. Serious adverse events were rare and none were determined to be related to vaccination. Non-inferior immune responses for extended two-dose regimens of 2vHPV support dosing flexibility. For up to 24 months, one dose of 2vHPV elicited immunogenicity that was similar to one dose of 4vHPV, for which single-dose efficacy has been shown, supporting a single-dose use of 2vHPV.
