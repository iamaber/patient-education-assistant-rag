        "title": "Present but Overlooked: A Scoping Review of Instruments and Approaches for Measuring Presenteeism Related to Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drug Use.",
        "abstract": "The use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs (ATOD) can impact workplace productivity. Whilst presenteeism has a greater impact on productivity than absenteeism, it is less visible and often receives less attention. Measuring ATOD-related presenteeism is important for identifying the impact of AOD use and evaluating workplace AOD interventions. However, there is no standard approach to determining ATOD-related presenteeism. The aim of this scoping review was therefore to identify and describe different approaches and instruments used to determine ATOD-related presenteeism. A scoping review of publications up to and including December 2024 was undertaken across three major databases: Scopus, Ovid Medline, and the Latin-American and Caribbean System on Health Sciences (LILACS). The population was workers for whom ATOD-related presenteeism was reported, the concept was presenteeism, and the context was the workplace. The review included 27 original studies. The most common approach (n = 22 studies) was indirect, which involved examining differences in presenteeism between workers who did and did not use ATOD. Direct approaches-asking participants explicitly about their ATOD-related presenteeism-were less common (n = 5 studies) and focussed exclusively on alcohol. Across both approaches, there was substantial variation in instruments (n = 4 direct, n = 10 presenteeism, n = 18 ATOD), use of validated instruments, recall periods, and ways of reporting findings, which may compromise the interpretation and synthesis of studies. This scoping review provides an evidence base for informing approach and instrument selection. It establishes the need for further research on the impact of different approaches and instruments on findings. This information is essential to encourage more rigorous and standardised approaches to determining ATOD-related presenteeism and evaluating workplace interventions.",

        "abstract": "Despite the associated major morbidities, advances in neonatal care units have improved the survival rates of extremely preterm infants. However, the varying survival rates make it challenging to set policy decisions around the standardization of care. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the global survival rate of extremely preterm infants and to compare it across different income levels and over time during the last two decades. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted across major databases, including PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, AJOL, Google Scholar and Google, to identify relevant articles. All peer-reviewed studies reported the survival rate of extremely preterm infants (born before 29 weeks' gestation) between January 1<sup>st,</sup> 2000, and June 25th, 2024, were included. Outcomes were compared between Epoch 1 (2000-2015, Millennium Developmental Goals period) and Epoch 2 (2016-2024, Sustainable Developmental Goals period). DerSimonian‒Laird random effects model was fitted to estimate the pooled weighted outcomes. A total of 217 studies involving 917,176 infants were included. Based on published data, 61.4% (95% CI: 58.13-64.81) of extremely preterm infants survived to discharge, and 51.7% (95% CI: 44.25-59.22) of survivors were discharged without major morbidity. Survival rate was significantly lower in low- and middle-income countries (44.3%) compared to high-income countries (69.3%). Among low- and middle-income countries, survival improved from 38% during the epoch 1 to 44.8% during the epoch 2. While in high-income countries it was 69.9% during epoch 1 and 64.2% during epoch 2. These findings are based on reported literature; may not fully reflect outcomes in low-resource settings where data are limited and underreported. Variability in the inclusion and care of borderline viable infants also contributes to the heterogeneity and uncertainty of the estimates. Survival of extremely preterm infants varies widely across settings, with fewer than half surviving in low- and middle-income countries. While some improvement was observed in these regions during the Sustainable Developmental Goals period, comparisons across epochs and regions should be interpreted cautiously due to differences in data availability and population characteristics. These variations underscore the need for context-specific strategies that balance available resources, cultural values, and ethical considerations. Further population-level data, particularly from low-and middle-income countries, are essential to inform equitable global neonatal care policies. PROSPERO (CDR42023447612 (PROSPERO (york.ac.uk)).

        "abstract": "Characterizing black carbon (BC) on a fine scale globally is essential for understanding its climate and health impacts. However, sparse BC mass measurements in different parts of the world and coarse model resolution have inhibited evaluation of global BC emission inventories. Here, we apply globally distributed BC mass measurements from the Surface Particulate Matter Network (SPARTAN) and complementary measurement networks to evaluate contemporary BC emission inventories. We use a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) in its high-performance configuration (GCHP) for high-resolution simulations to relate BC emissions to ambient concentrations for comparison with measurements. Here we find that simulations using the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) emission inventory exhibit skill (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.73) in representing variability in SPARTAN measurements across primarily developed regions with low BC concentrations but exhibit pronounced discrepancy (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.00019) across high-BC regions in the Global South, underestimating BC by 38%. Alternative inventories (EDGAR, HTAP) yield similar results. These findings motivate renewed attention to the challenging task of characterizing BC emissions from low- and middle-income countries.",

        "title": "Network Pharmacology Approaches to Myocardial Infarction Reperfusion Injury: Exploring Mechanisms, Pathophysiology, and Novel Therapies.",
        "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. While timely reperfusion therapies such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and thrombolysis are essential for salvaging ischemic myocardium, they can paradoxically exacerbate tissue injury through a process known as myocardial infarction reperfusion injury (MIRI). MIRI can contribute to up to 50% of the final infarct size, significantly diminishing the benefits of revascularization and leading to worsened cardiac outcomes. The pathophysiology of MIRI involves complex, interrelated mechanisms including oxidative stress, calcium overload, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and dysregulated autophagy. Post-reperfusion recovery is further complicated by structural and functional abnormalities such as microvascular obstruction, endothelial dysfunction, and myocardial stunning. Clinically, distinguishing reperfusion injury from ischemic damage is challenging and often requires the use of sensitive biomarkers, such as cardiac troponins, alongside advanced imaging modalities. Although a range of pharmacological (e.g., antioxidants, calcium channel blockers, mitochondrial stabilizers, anti-inflammatory agents) and non-pharmacological (e.g., hypothermia, gene therapy, stem cell-based therapies) interventions have shown promise in preclinical studies, their clinical translation remains limited. This is largely due to the multifactorial and dynamic nature of MIRI. In this context, network pharmacology offers a systems-level approach to understanding the complex biological interactions involved in MIRI, facilitating the identification of multi-target therapeutic strategies. Integrating network pharmacology with omics technologies and precision medicine holds potential for advancing cardioprotective therapies. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying MIRI, examines the current clinical challenges, and explores emerging therapeutic strategies. Emphasis is placed on bridging the translational gap through validated, multi-target approaches and large-scale, multicenter clinical trials. Ultimately, this work aims to support the development of innovative and effective interventions for improving outcomes in patients with myocardial infarction.",

The 2017 WHO resolution on cancer prevention and control highlighted the importance of developing and implementing National Cancer Control Plans (NCCPs). We reviewed the current landscape of NCCPs in 21 countries of the Asian National Cancer Centers Alliance. We found marked variation in plan status across Asia, with frameworks ranging from comprehensive NCCPs to non-communicable disease plans that include cancer to no plans. Over 90% of plans included components for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention or cancer treatment. Air pollution, a critical and growing cancer risk factor in the region, was addressed in only 43% of plans, with most concentrated in middle-income countries. Treatment protocols were included in 91% of plans, but end-of-life care appeared in only 48%. Stakeholder involvement appeared in 86% of plans, but legal and evaluation mechanisms were less common (57% each).

        "abstract": "Obesity is a global health concern, affecting nearly half of the world's population and significantly increasing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Among various cardiac impacts, left atrial (LA) dysfunction is a notable complication, especially given its association with atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and diastolic dysfunction. This comprehensive review synthesizes findings from studies across age groups, from children to adults, evaluating obesity-induced alterations in LA structure and function. Using advanced diagnostic tools like speckle tracking echocardiography, we examine the impact of obesity on LA function, the potential reversibility of LA dysfunction, and implications for CVD progression. Studies show that elevated body mass index (BMI) correlates with LA enlargement, increased stiffness, and impaired reservoir and conduit strain, with specific changes observed across different cardiovascular conditions. In children, obesity-related insulin resistance is associated with increased LA stiffness, marking early indicators of metabolic and cardiac dysfunction. In adults, higher BMI independently reduces LA strain, compromising function and raising the likelihood of AF recurrence post-cardioversion or percutaneous interventions. Additionally, clinical manifestations such as exercise intolerance in obese HFpEF patients highlight LA stiffness as a predictor of poorer quality of life and reduced physical capacity. Importantly, weight loss interventions, including bariatric surgery, show promise in reversing LA dysfunction, suggesting a potential for reducing obesity-related cardiac risks. Our review underscores the value of incorporating LA strain metrics in routine cardiac assessments to identify subclinical changes early and guide preventive strategies in obese patients. Further research into therapeutic approaches targeting LA function is essential for reducing HFpEF incidence and improving cardiovascular outcomes in obesity.",

Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism of the NiV polymerase and build tools for anti-NiV drug discovery.

We identify two conserved loops in the polyribonucleotidyltransferase (PRNTase) domain of L and the binding between RdRp-PRNTase and CD domains. To further assess the mechanism of NiV polymerase activity, we establish a highly sensitive radioactive-labeled RNA synthesis assay and identify a back-priming activity in the NiV polymerase as well as a fluorescence and luminescent-based non-radioactive polymerase assay to enable high-throughput screening for L protein inhibitors. The combination of structural analysis and the development of both high-sensitive and high-throughput biochemical assays will enable the identification of new direct-acting antiviral candidates for treating highly pathogenic henipaviruses.",

        "abstract": "Progressive neuronal loss and dysfunction characterize neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, spinal cord injury, and stroke, making them difficult to treat. Curcumin, a bioactive substance derived from the turmeric plant (Curcuma longa), is interesting due to its potential neuroprotective properties. This review thoroughly shows the cellular and molecular signaling mechanisms that curcumin utilizes to provide neuroprotective effects in NDs. Curcumin regulates several signaling pathways linked to neuroprotection, such as those that reduce oxidative stress, prevent Aβ formation, and decrease neuroinflammation. NF-κB suppression reduces inflammatory responses, while Nrf2 activation boosts antioxidant response element expression. Furthermore, curcumin enhances autophagy and neurotrophic factor expression, facilitating the removal of harmful protein aggregates. The function of curcumin as a metal chelator is emphasized particularly to iron and other metal dysregulations linked to neurodegenerative processes. Curcumin's capacity to regulate metal ion homeostasis is essential since the pathophysiology of NDs is significantly influenced by metal-induced oxidative stress and toxic buildup. It shows potential therapeutic effects by reducing oxidative damage and chelating excess metals. Clinical research indicates that curcumin can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, making it an effective treatment option. The regulation of these pathways reduces neuronal damage and improves neurons' survival and functionality. In addition, curcumin's anti-inflammatory properties and low toxicity make it a promising long-term treatment option for NDs. Therefore, this review emphasizes the potential of curcumin as a targeted neuroprotective compound, presenting recent clinical insights and experimental data. Future studies should optimize curcumin formulations and delivery systems to enhance its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy.",

This trend undermines progress toward Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.4, which seeks to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one-third by 2030. Despite the availability of effective and relatively affordable interventions, addressing NCDs requires sustained, coordinated efforts and robust monitoring systems. Facility-based monitoring offers a dynamic alternative to static surveys, enabling continuous assessment of healthcare quality and utilization. This study followed a systematic approach to develop standardized global and national NCD monitoring indicators, using the Donabedian model as a conceptual framework. It focused on four major NCD categories: hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancers. The methodology included systematic scoping reviews from inception up to November 2021 and a multi-round Delphi process involving global experts to assess the validity and feasibility of proposed indicators. This study was funded internally by WHO. There were no payments to participants. The final output consisted of 81 validated indicators-22 core and 59 optional. These indicators demonstrated high feasibility and relevance for facility-based monitoring of NCD service delivery. They provide actionable metrics for assessing and improving the quality of care across diverse health system settings. This study highlights the urgent need for comprehensive, context-sensitive NCD monitoring frameworks.

Ontologies, which are structured frameworks that outline the relationships between concepts in a certain field, offer a crucial foundation for combining different biological data. Novel insights into the construction of a precision medicine approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are given by growing advancements in the area of pharmacogenomics. Affected parts of the central nervous system may develop neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, autism spectrum, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These models allow for standard and helpful data marking, which is needed for crossdisciplinary study and teamwork. With case studies, you can see how ontologies have been used to find biomarkers, understand how sicknesses work, and make models for predicting how drugs will work and how the disease will get worse. For example, problems with data quality, meaning variety, and the need for constant changes to reflect the growing body of scientific knowledge are discussed in this review. It also looks at how semantic data can be mixed with cutting-edge computer methods such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to make brain disease diagnostic and prediction models more exact and accurate. These collaborative networks aim to identify patients at risk, identify patients in the preclinical or early stages of illness, and develop tailored preventative interventions to enhance patient quality of life and prognosis. They also seek to identify new, robust, and effective methods for these patient identification tasks.

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative condition characterized by progressive cognitive decline and behavioral changes. These symptoms are primarily driven by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, tau tangles, and persistent neuroinflammation. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, play a crucial role in the disease's progression. Initially, these cells protectively respond to Aβ deposits, working to clear plaques and support neuronal health. However, prolonged activation of microglia leads to a transition from a neuroprotective state to a pro-inflammatory one, ultimately contributing to neuronal damage and worsening disease progression. This review explores the molecular mechanisms responsible for microglial dysfunction in AD, with a particular emphasis on key inflammatory pathways, including NF-κB, MAPK, and TLR4 signaling. These pathways drive the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, which further amplify neuroinflammation, disrupt synaptic plasticity, and contribute to neuronal loss. Additionally, emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating microglial activity to reduce neuroinflammation and enhance Aβ clearance are examined. A key focus is placed on the future of AD research, emphasizing the importance of longitudinal studies to gain a deeper understanding of how microglia contribute to disease progression over time. The review also highlights the potential of personalized medicine, which seeks to tailor treatments based on an individual's unique genetic and environmental risk factors. Notably, genetic predispositions such as the APOE4 allele, along with environmental influences like air pollution and chronic infections, are identified as significant modulators of microglial activity. Given the complexity of AD, a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach will be essential for advancing research and developing more effective therapeutic interventions.",

        "abstract": "Microplastics (MPs) are widespread contaminants in aquatic ecosystems and pose significant threats to both organisms and the environment. Their small size, high surface area, and capacity to adsorb toxic chemicals allow MPs to infiltrate food webs, affecting organisms across trophic levels. This review explores the intricate mechanisms by which MPs induce reproductive and endocrine toxicity, focusing on their physical and chemical properties, bioaccumulation dynamics, and associated molecular pathways. MPs interfere with hormonal homeostasis, oxidative stress responses, and apoptotic pathways, leading to disruptions in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, impaired steroidogenesis, and gonadal dysfunction. These effects manifest as reduced fertility, altered gametogenesis, and multigenerational reproductive impairments across diverse aquatic taxa. Furthermore, MPs serve as carriers for endocrine-disrupting chemicals, compounding their adverse effects on organisms and aquatic biodiversity. Through a synthesis of recent research, this review identifies key signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K-AKT, mTOR, NF-κB, PPAR and NLRP3 inflammasome, that may play a role in MP-induced reproductive toxicity. The findings underscore the urgent need for advanced mitigation strategies, regulatory frameworks, and further research to combat the ecological consequences of MP pollution. Prioritizing targeted interventions is essential to safeguard aquatic biodiversity and ensure ecosystem resilience against the pervasive threat of MPs.",

        "abstract": "In 2022, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced new cases of the developing Monkeypox Virus (MPXV), a zoonotic orthopoxvirus viral infection that mimics smallpox signs. Despite the ongoing infection, no proper medication is available to completely overcome this infection. The study aims to construct a multi-epitope vaccine targeting Monkeypox Virus (MPXV) membrane glycoprotein to provoke robust immune responses. To construct a potential immuno-dominant epitope vaccine to combat MPXV. The target sequence, sourced from the UAE-to-India travel case, was analyzed to identify potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes (MHC-I and MHC-II). Immunodominant epitopes were selected and fused with β-defensin-I and PADRE to increase immunogenicity. The vaccine was modeled, docked with TLR3, and subjected to a 500 ns molecular dynamics simulation for stability analysis. Immune responses and bacterial expression were also evaluated. The vaccine, comprising 230 amino acids, demonstrated antigenicity (0.6620), non-allergenicity, and broad population coverage. Selected epitopes included 3 B-cells, 4 MHC-I, and 2 MHC-II, ensuring a potent immunodominant profile. Docking with TLR3 revealed a binding affinity of -17.2 kcal/mol, while simulations confirmed their stability. Cloning (pET28a (+)) and immune response analyses showed a strong immunogenic profile, including elevated IgG1, IgM, and antigen levels, supported by a Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) of 1.0. The proposed multi-epitope vaccine shows promise against MPXV. However, further in vivo and in vitro investigations are essential to confirm its immune efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Implementation fidelity is critical for the efficient delivery of health services including leprosy services. Healthcare providers are important in monitoring the disease's progression, managing complications, and cross-checking prescribed medications. This study explored implementation fidelity in leprosy care and support for disability prevention and management in Rupandehi district, Nepal. A qualitative case study design was adopted based on implementation research principles. From 25th February to 30th April 2024, data were collected through multiple sources and methods, including key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and observation. Semi-structured interview guidelines and qualitative checklists facilitated the data collection process. Participants were chosen using purposive and selective sampling methods. The data were inductively coded using qualitative analysis software. Thematic analysis was done with codes generated and aggregated to form sub-themes and develop themes. The study revealed that healthcare providers consistently adhered to national leprosy operational guidelines, ensuring sufficient fidelity by prompt multi-drug therapy, case diagnosis, complicated case referral, and regular follow-up. In contrast, poor adherence was demonstrated in the complication management of lepra reactions, ulcer cases, and self-care. The major barriers to leprosy services were financial hardship, complication management, pill burden, drug side effects, and institutional obstacles. In contrast, the facilitators to leprosy services included adequate human resources, treatment supporter's involvement, effective communications, external development partner's role, transportation incentives, and local government support. Healthcare providers demonstrated sufficient adherence to leprosy operational guidelines. While significant gaps were evident in complication management, addressing financial and systematic barriers and leveraging facilitators is essential to strengthening leprosy care and support for disability prevention and management.",

        "abstract": "The genus Acalypha (family Euphorbiaceae) has a longstanding role in traditional medicine across South Asia, used to treat conditions such as diabetes, asthma, gastrointestinal disorders, and skin ailments. Its widespread ethnomedicinal use suggests promising pharmacological applications. This review comprehensively examines the origin, habitat, taxonomy, conventional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological properties of Acalypha species (AS). Data were compiled from more than 100 peer-reviewed studies retrieved from multiple scientific databases (e.g., PubMed, PubChem, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and others). Phytochemical structures were generated using Chemaxon Marvin Sketch, and data were evaluated to assess chemical diversity and biological activity. Key species such as Acalypha hispida, Acalypha paniculata, Acalypha fruticosa, Acalypha wilkesiana, and Acalypha indica are prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. These plants contain various bioactive compounds, including alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, and phenolics, which demonstrate antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and wound-healing effects. These findings support their conventional applications in managing a range of health conditions. However, toxicity profiles vary among species, highlighting the need for careful evaluation. The Acalypha genus represents a valuable source of bioactive compounds with significant therapeutic potential. Although traditional use and preclinical evidence are encouraging, limited clinical data and variability in safety profiles necessitate further investigation. Rigorous pharmacological validation and standardization are essential for the safe and effective integration of AS into modern medicine.",

        "title": "Association of Air Flow Limitation Severity with eGFR in Stable COPD Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study.",
        "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is primarily a lung disease, but its consequences also affect other vital organs. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁), a basic spirometry finding along with others (Predicted FEV₁% and FVC), is essential for COPD diagnosis and severity analysis. Renal functional evaluation is essential, in addition to other systemic evaluations. Its evaluation is important because drugs used for the treatment of COPD are mostly excreted through the kidneys, which may cause its impairment. The estimated GFR (eGFR) by the modification of the diet in renal disease (MDRD) study group equation can approximate the actual GFR. This study aimed to elicit the association between airflow limitation severity and eGFR in stable COPD patients. This cross-sectional observational study included 95 patients with stable COPD who presented at the NIDCH between June 2018 and June 2019. The mean spirometry indices were compared with the eGFR-based groups (eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m² and eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m²). Correlation test was done to elicit the association of FEV₁ with eGFR. In addition, the prediction capability of eGFR along with other clinically relevant effector variables for FEV₁ was analyzed. FEV₁ was strongly correlated with eGFR (r=0.754, p<0.001). Predicted FEV₁% and FVC had moderate correlations with eGFR (r=0.646, p<0.001 and r=0.691, p<0.001, respectively), whereas FEV₁/FVC had weak correlations with eGFR (r=0.440, p<0.001). eGFR showed good prediction capability (β=-0.176, p<0.001) among other clinically relevant effector variables (age, sex, smoking, exacerbation history, mMRC grade, CAT score and BMI). All spirometry indices (FEV₁, PFEV₁%, FVC and FEV₁/FVC) were correlated with eGFR. FEV₁ was strongly correlated (positively) with eGFR and showed linear relation. Furthermore, eGFR had a good predictive capability for FEV₁. FEV₁ in stable COPD patients can be used as a predictor of renal function (eGFR), enabling early detection of renal functional impairment. Based on this, further evaluation, preventive measures or modifications in treatment strategy could be adopted accordingly.",

        "abstract": "Rodents represent the most diverse order of mammals, comprising over 2200 species and nearly 42% of global mammalian biodiversity. They are major reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi, and are particularly effective at transmitting diseases, especially synanthropic species that live in close proximity to humans. As of April 2025, approximately 15,205 rodent-associated viruses have been identified across 32 viral families. Among these, key zoonotic agents belong to the <i>Arenaviridae</i>, <i>Hantaviridae</i>, <i>Picornaviridae</i>, <i>Coronaviridae</i>, and <i>Poxviridae</i> families. Due to their adaptability to both urban and rural environments, rodents serve as efficient vectors across diverse ecological landscapes. Environmental and anthropogenic factors, such as climate change, urbanization, deforestation, and emerging pathogens, are increasingly linked to rising outbreaks of rodent-borne diseases. This review synthesizes current knowledge on rodent-borne viral zoonoses, focusing on their taxonomy, biology, host associations, transmission dynamics, clinical impact, and public health significance. It underscores the critical need for early detection, effective surveillance, and integrated control strategies. A multidisciplinary approach, including enhanced vector control, improved environmental sanitation, and targeted public education, is essential for mitigating the growing threat of rodent-borne zoonoses to global health.",

        "abstract": "Achieving the Sustainable Development Goal of reducing child mortality to <25 deaths per 1000 live births by 2030 requires strategies to prevent diarrheal disease-related morbidity and mortality. Accurate etiological diagnosis is essential. This study used postmortem diagnostics to investigate the contribution of diarrhea to under-5 mortality and examine co-morbidities and co-infections in Africa and South Asia. Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) generates data on child deaths through minimally invasive tissue sampling, clinical record review, and verbal autopsies. Multidisciplinary panels assign cause(s) of death using WHO International Classification of Diseases. This analysis included deaths among children aged 1-59 months enrolled from 18 December 2016-31 December 2023 across six African sites (Ethiopia, Mali, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Mozambique, South Africa) and Bangladesh. Of 1517 deaths assessed, diarrhea was in the causal pathway in 240 (15.8%). The proportion of diarrhea-related deaths was highest in Ethiopia (41.0%, 34/83), followed by Bangladesh, (30.0%, 3/10), Mozambique (21.7%, 56/258), Mali (17.5%, 18/103), Kenya (13.9%, 51/366), Sierra Leone (12.8%, 46/358), and South Africa (9.4%, 32/339). Diarrhea was underlying cause in 44.2% (106/240) of cases and immediate/antecedent cause in 58.3% (140/240), with some deaths involving multiple roles in the causal chain. When diarrhea was underlying cause, sepsis (33.0%) and lower respiratory infections (25.5%) were common downstream conditions; when an antecedent/immediate cause, leading underlying causes were malnutrition (64.3%) and HIV (13.6%). No pathogen was identified in 49.6% (119/240) of diarrhea-related deaths; among these, diarrhea was underlying cause in 42.9%. Among the 121 pathogen-attributed deaths, the most frequent were EAEC (34.7%), typical EPEC (15.7%), Shigella/EIEC (14.0%), ST-ETEC (12.4%), rotavirus (26.4%), and adenovirus (non-40/41: 19.0%; 40/41: 5.0%). These pathogens were frequently identified as co-infections. Diarrheal disease accounted for a substantial share of child deaths across CHAMPS sites.

        "abstract": "Candida auris, a medically multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen, has recently emerged as the primary one that poses a global public health threat. Although C. auris was first described in Japan, numerous cases of C. auris infections have been reported globally and clustered in four major clades (I, II, III, and IV). In 2019 and 2024, a potential V clade in Iran and VI clade in Bangladesh were described. Nevertheless, limited pathogenicity data of the fifth clade are available compared to the other clades. This study evaluated the pathogenicity of fluconazole-resistant C. auris clade V and the therapeutic efficacy of amphotericin B in an immunocompromised mouse model, with C. albicans serving as a standard pathogen. The infection's advancement was tracked by evaluating mortality rates, fungal burden, and histopathological alterations. The C. auris clade V strain exhibited the highest fungal load in heart and kidney tissues on days 3, 5, 7, and 10, with the lowest load observed in brain tissue. In contrast, mice infected with the C. albicans strain showed the highest fungal load in the spleen on days 3, 5, and 10 and in the heart on the 7th day post-infection. Conversely, the average survival time for mice infected with C. auris was 14 days with drug treatment, demonstrating that AMB treatment significantly improved the survival rate of mice infected with C. auris clade V. This study highlights the differing pathogenic behaviors of C. auris clade V and C. albicans. Although C. albicans exhibits greater virulence in untreated infections, C. auris clade V remains a serious threat, even at lower colony levels. The improved survival rates in infected mice treated with amphotericin B underscore the importance of effective therapeutic interventions. Further research is essential to enhance our understanding of these pathogens and optimize treatment protocols.",

        "abstract": "Proton pump inhibitors are essential for treating moderate-to-severe gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcers, esophagitis, and related conditions by increasing gastric pH and inhibiting hydrogen ion discharge into the stomach. However, prolonged use may lead to adverse effects along with reduced efficacy. Our research investigates the strategic modification of omeprazole (OMP) derivatives to improve their binding affinity to targeted proteins, thereby enhancing their chemical reactivity, stability, and toxicity profiles. A total of 22 novel OMP analogues were designed through structural alterations, focusing on the benzimidazole and pyridine rings. The geometrical attributes of the analogues were further confirmed through spectral and quantum computational analysis based on density functional theory (DFT) and a B3LYP/6-31G+ G (d, p) basis set. The molecular docking with PTAAC1 presented that most of the analogues had similar or higher binding affinities and nonbonding interactions, including OMP3, OMP19, and OMP21, with binding energies of -7.3, -8.3, and -8.1 kcal/mol compared to the OMP at -7.1 kcal/mol. Pharmacokinetic, biological, and toxicological profiles via ADMET and PASS predictions also demonstrated increased safety and therapeutic potential. MD simulation also showed good stability of OMP3, OMP19, and OMP21 in binding to PTAAC1, and the RMSD, RMSF, ligand RMSD, rGyr, SASA, MolSA, PolSA, and hydrogen bond analysis also suggested superior drug potential compared to OMP. Additionally, the post-simulation MM/GBSA analysis revealed that OMP3 (-36.91 kcal/mol) outperformed OMP19 (-26.45) and OMP21 (-12.61). The protein binding site's high stability and elevated negative binding free energy value further indicate a robust compound-protein interaction with OMP3. However, principal component analysis (PCA) showed the highest variance for OMP21, accounting for 50.66%, 21.58%, and 6.51%, respectively, for PC1, PC2, and PC3. These findings could lead to the development of OMP3 and OMP21 as potential next-generation PPIs with enhanced pharmacological activity and improved side-effect profiles, necessitating more in vitro and in vivo testing.",

        "title": "Fatty acids and physical activity are critical for β-cell mass and insulin sensitivity: Pathways to T2D and prevention.",
        "abstract": "Existing mathematical models investigating the progression of type 2 diabetes (T2D) over time primarily focus on glucose, insulin, β-cell mass, and other related factors, while often omitting fatty acids (FA) as an explicit variable-despite FA being a major energy source for the body. There exists a complex network of dynamical interactions among glucose, insulin, FA, and β-cell mass. To gain deeper insights into the metabolic dynamics and pathophysiology of T2D, it is essential to incorporate FA into such models. In this paper, we extend the classic Topp's GIβ model by explicitly incorporating FA and exploring its interactions with glucose, insulin, and β-cell mass. A new formula for insulin sensitivity (S<sub>I</sub>) is proposed to better capture the impaired effect of FA on S<sub>I</sub>, enabling the exploration of diabetes development pathways and strategies for prevention or delay. Model simulations align well with clinical data and successfully replicate key characteristics of T2D progression, including declining S<sub>I</sub>, reduced β-cell mass, a sedentary lifestyle, and excessive dietary intake. Our results demonstrate a strong positive correlation between glucose and FA levels, indicating that elevated FA is associated with increased glucose concentrations. Model analysis shows that FA levels in diabetic subjects rise significantly as a result of T2D development. Numerical analyses indicate that maintaining adequate physical activity or reducing dietary excess effectively preserves S<sub>I</sub> and β-cell mass, thereby reducing the risk of developing T2D. Most notably, our detailed simulations reveal a striking pattern: in healthy and non-diabetic individuals, FA levels consistently remain below glucose levels across their lifespan. In contrast, in individuals with T2D, FA levels initially remain lower but begin to increase sharply and tangle with glucose levels, and then surpass glucose concentrations near the time of β-cell failure. These patterns suggest that elevated FA may play a contributory role in increasing glucose levels, reducing insulin sensitivity, and ultimately leading to hyperglycemia. Our findings support the notion that glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity accelerate β-cell decline, impair insulin secretion, and drive T2D progression. Elevated FA thus emerges not only as a contributing pathway but also as a potential biomarker for monitoring disease development. Furthermore, the observed relationship between glucose and FA levels seems suggesting a quantitative marker that could be used to track progression toward T2D.",

To effectively lower the death rate from this disease, it is essential to create public health methods, including developing new biomarkers that facilitate screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy response prediction. CRC-derived Exosomes are a type of extracellular vesicle that transport functional molecules like proteins, lipids, nucleic acids (DNA, mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and noncoding RNA), and other metabolites, which act as molecular cargos to facilitate transportation. Exosomes generated and secreted from cancer cells are key biomarkers for early, noninvasive cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response, with their biogenesis in CRC offering molecular insights.

Given the substantial disease burden, understanding the current diagnostic and treatment patterns for EGFRm NSCLC from an Asian perspective is essential. This expert opinion presents recommendations from Asian experts on molecular testing and treatment of first-line and second-line EGFRm NSCLC. The recommendations aim to optimize patient outcomes by providing a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management, considering the high prevalence of EGFR mutations in the Asian population. The experts discussed and recommended approaches for optimal management of EGFRm NSCLC. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing is recommended to be included in the reimbursement scheme, and the turnaround time of testing should be shortened, considering the high burden of the disease in Asia. The panel recommended careful selection of patients for osimertinib+chemotherapy or lazertinib+amivantamab based on safety and efficacy profile, patient age, and disease status. While the panel agreed that osimertinib+chemotherapy is acceptable for these patients, dose adjustment and careful patient selection are recommended to optimize safety outcomes. For lazertinib+amivantamab, measures to mitigate adverse events such as the use of pre-medication with steroids, prophylactic anticoagulants, and dose modification are recommended.

Two distinct VSDs were identified in the interventricular septum (IVS): the first, a larger perimembranous VSD involving the inlet part with extensions toward the subaortic region, measured 11 mm × 16 mm; the second, a smaller VSD in the mid-part of the trabecular septum, measured 4 mm × 4 mm. Both VSDs permitted bidirectional shunting, predominantly left-to-right, contributing to the patient's cyanosis and pulmonary hypertension, with the larger VSD being routable to the aorta. Treatment involved stabilization with medical management to address pulmonary hypertension and preparation for corrective surgery. Timely surgical correction, including the closure of VSDs and rerouting of the ventriculo-arterial connections, is crucial for improving outcomes. Ongoing follow-up is essential to monitor for complications such as arrhythmias, right heart failure, and progression of pulmonary hypertension. The case underscores the complexity of DORV and the need for a multidisciplinary approach in its management.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have witnessed notable advancements, revolutionizing various fields of research and medicine. Specifically, advancements of AI and the rapid growth of machine learning hold immense potential to significantly impact emergency medicine. This narrative review aimed to summarize AI applications in prehospital emergency care, emergency radiology, triage and patient classification, emergency diagnosis and interventions, pediatric emergency care, trauma care, outcome prediction, as well as the legal and ethical challenges and limitations of AI use in emergency medicine. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Web of Science, Scopus, and Medline using a wide range of artificial intelligence and machine learning-related keywords combined with terms related to emergency medicine to identify relevant published studies. The findings show that AI-powered tools can assist clinicians in emergency departments in improving the management of prehospital emergency care, emergency radiology, triage, emergency department workflow, complex diagnoses, treatment, clinical decision-making, pediatric emergency care, trauma care, and the prediction of admissions, discharges, complications, and outcomes. However, the majority of these applications have been reported in retrospective studies, whereas randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are essential to determine the true value of AI in emergency settings. These applications can serve as effective tools in emergency departments when they are continuously supplied with high-quality real-time data and are adopted through collaboration between skilled data scientists and clinicians. Implementing these AI-assisted tools in emergency departments requires adequate infrastructure and machine learning operation systems. Since emergency medicine involves various clinical decision-making scenarios based on classifications, flowcharts, and well-structured approaches, future well-designed prospective studies are necessary to achieve the goal of replacing conventional methods with new AI and machine learning techniques.",

        "abstract": "Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare congenital vascular anomalies that increase the risk of severe complications, such as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), necessitating complex, multidisciplinary management. This case report describes the successful treatment of a 30-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with an acute, severe headache, nausea, and neurological deficits due to a ruptured AVM causing ICH. Initial neuroimaging revealed a significant right parietal lobe hemorrhage, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) confirmed a Spetzler-Martin Grade II AVM, indicating moderate surgical complexity; the patient underwent staged interventions, starting with endovascular embolization using the Onyx liquid embolic system to reduce nidus perfusion, followed by microsurgical resection with intraoperative neuromonitoring, resulting in complete AVM removal and near-normal neurological recovery at discharge. The integration of neurosurgery, interventional radiology, and neuro-anesthesiology expertise facilitated a tailored approach, leveraging advanced imaging and therapeutic techniques to minimize procedural risks and optimize outcomes. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis, precise imaging with tools like DSA, and a collaborative, staged treatment strategy in achieving favorable results in AVM-associated ICH. It also emphasizes the value of personalized care plans and continuous postoperative follow-up to ensure long-term success and detect potential recurrence. Lessons learned include the efficacy of combining embolization and resection for moderate-complexity AVMs and the need for ongoing research to refine protocols and improve prognosis, reinforcing that multidisciplinary coordination is essential for managing such intricate vascular anomalies effectively.",

        "abstract": "Fruits, which are packed with nutrients, vitamins, and antioxidants, have been known for their numerous health benefits and curative powers, and are utilized in conventional medicine. Aegle Marmelos, Lemon, and Hog Plum are tangy fruits widely recognized in Asian countries for containing a plentiful supply of bioactive substances. They are also highly valuable in boosting metabolism, possessing tremendous therapeutic properties, and holding financial significance. The leaves of these fruit trees are as essential as their fruits, as they contain versatile medicinal and dietary benefits of immense value. However, these leaves are often affected by various fungal and other diseases, which reduce the ability for healthy growth and productivity of both fruits and leaves. Plants infected with various leaf diseases can produce fewer fruits, which are also of lower quality due to failure to reach maturity and lack of sufficient nutritional value. For these reasons, there is a risk of an outbreak in orchards, which can lead to significant financial losses for both producers and the agricultural sector. This signifies that the early identification of leaf diseases and the management of orchards are essential to minimize the impact of leaf diseases and mitigate these issues, ensuring the healthy production of valuable medicinal fruits. In this paper, various infected leaf images are collected from different regions of Rangpur, providing a comprehensive dataset comprising 3941 images. The dataset includes images of three different plant leaves, where 1513 images of Aegle Marmelos, 1232 images of Lemon, and 1196 of Hog plum, where each of the categories encompasses several classes of common leaf diseases. Through this dataset, an early and accurate digital detection system can be employed, allowing producers to clearly identify diseases instead of relying on traditional methods. The precise and timely identification of leaf diseases enables the control of these diseases by taking necessary actions, ensuring the sustainability of plants, and promoting the healthy growth of these invaluable medicinal fruits.",

        "abstract": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant and avoidable complication that may occur after total hip arthroplasty (THA). Various mechanical and chemical prophylactic measures may mitigate this elevated risk of death and functional impairment. Consequently, early prevention of VTE is essential via the identification of related risk factors. A search was performed using the databases of PubMed, ScienceDirect, PEDro, and Cochrane Library to get papers from 2004 to 2024 in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English that included at least one group undergoing intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) treatment as a prophylactic intervention after total hip arthroplasty (THA) were included. This systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO. The quality evaluation of the included studies was conducted using the PEDro scale and the Cochrane risk of bias instrument. We selected 12 studies from a total of 733 based on predetermined criteria. A total of 2,352 patients of both genders underwent total hip arthroplasty, comprising 1,294 patients in the experimental group and 1,058 patients in the control group across the included studies. The results indicate that the combination of IPC and pharmaceutical agents was the most effective treatment for reducing VTE risk in patients who underwent THA. IPC therapy is very effective in avoiding VTE, particularly when used in combination with pharmacological therapies after THA surgery. The best ways to lower the risk of VTE are to use both IPC and anticoagulants together. However, IPC alone may lower the risk of VTE compared to not using any prevention at all. In general, IPC is a crucial component of comprehensive VTE prevention strategies in THA.",

This paper reviews public policies and programmes delivering preconception nutrition interventions in eight South Asian countries, targeting married pre-pregnant women aged 15-49 years and identifies the systems bottlenecks in programme implementation. Most countries, except Sri Lanka, lack universal programmes for health and nutrition screening, provision of essential micronutrients, counselling on healthy eating and treatment for at-risk women. Even in countries, where supportive policies exist, implementation of comprehensive nutrition services for pre-pregnant women faces significant bottlenecks across six health system building blocks. Addressing these barriers is critical to improving intervention effectiveness, programme implementation, and informed decision-making.

Techniques such as weaving, knitting, and braiding allow for creating structures with customizable porosity, mechanical properties, and fiber alignment, which are essential for supporting cellular behaviors such as adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Recent developments have incorporated bioactive materials-like growth factors, peptides, and nanoparticles-into these textile-based scaffolds, greatly enhancing their functionality for applications in wound healing, skin regeneration, and organ engineering. The emergence of smart textiles, which utilize responsive polymers and nanotechnology, facilitates the on-demand delivery of therapeutic agents and provides electrical stimulation to repair neural and muscular tissues.

        "abstract": "Using remote monitoring technology in the context of Alzheimer disease (AD) care presents exciting new opportunities to lessen caregiver stress and improve patient care quality. The application of wearables, environmental sensors, and smart home systems designed specifically for patients with AD represents a promising interdisciplinary approach that integrates advanced technology with health care to enhance patient safety, monitor health parameters in real time, and provide comprehensive support to caregivers. The objectives of this study included evaluating the effectiveness of various remote sensing technologies in enhancing patient outcomes and identifying strategies to alleviate the burden on health care professionals and caregivers. Critical elements such as regulatory compliance, user-centered design, privacy and security considerations, and the overall efficacy of relevant technologies were comprehensively examined. Ultimately, this study aimed to propose a comprehensive remote monitoring framework tailored to the needs of patients with AD and related dementias. Guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework, we conducted a systematic review on remote monitoring for patients with AD and related dementias. Our search spanned 4 major electronic databases-Google Scholar, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and DBLP on February 20, 2024, with an updated search on May 18, 2024. A total of 31 publications met the inclusion criteria, highlighting 4 key research areas: existing remote monitoring technologies, balancing practicality and empathy, security and privacy in monitoring, and technology design for AD care. The studies revealed a strong focus on various remote monitoring methods for capturing behavioral, physiological, and environmental data yet showed a gap in evaluating these methods for patient and caregiver needs, privacy, and usability. The findings also indicated that many studies lacked robust reference standards and did not consistently apply critical appraisal criteria, underlining the need for comprehensive frameworks that better integrate these essential considerations. This comprehensive literature review of remote monitoring technologies for patients with AD provides an understanding of remote monitoring technologies, trends, and gaps in the current research and the significance of novel strategies for remote monitoring to enhance patient outcomes and reduce the burden among health professionals and caregivers. The proposed remote monitoring framework aims to inspire the development of new interdisciplinary research models that advance care for patients with AD.",

        "abstract": "Polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) are pervasive pollutants impacting animals across ecosystems, including livestock and wildlife, through contaminated food, water, and air. MPs may disrupt endocrine function, particularly affecting the thyroid gland, which is essential for metabolism and development. This study investigates the effects of PS-MPs on thyroid function in mice, offering insights relevant to veterinary care by examining changes in gene expression and biochemical markers. PS-MPs of 5 µm diameter were prepared in distilled water after probe sonication. Sixty male Swiss albino mice were divided into three groups: a control group and two treatment groups receiving 0.1 mg and 0.2 mg PS-MPs via oral gavage for 28 days. Mice were anesthetised, and thyroid tissues were collected for histopathological, biochemical, and gene expression analyses. Biochemical tests included catalase, superoxide dismutase, reactive oxygen species, and hormone levels. Histopathology and gene expression (TSHR and TPO) of thyroid-related genes were examined to assess PS-MPs induced effects. Exposure to PS-MPs in mice led to significant increases in calcium, thyroxin, free T3, free T4, ALP, AST, ALT, and amylase levels, alongside elevated oxidative stress markers. Conversely, the levels of TSH, calcitonin, magnesium and phosphate decreased. Histopathological analysis showed abnormal thyroid follicle development, decrease parafollicular cells, with colloid loss, haemorrhage, and necrosis. Gene expression analysis revealed a marked reduction in TSHR and TPO levels in PS-MPs treated groups, indicating thyroid dysfunction. These findings highlight the profound impact of PS-MPs on thyroid gland function in mice. These findings underscore the potential risks that PS-MPs pose to thyroid health, with potential consequences for other veterinary species. As environmental contamination rises, veterinarians may encounter more endocrine disorders linked to PS-MPs, emphasising the need for further research and preventive measures.",

        "title": "Assessing the Clinical Effectiveness of Radioimmunotherapy with Combined Radionuclide/Monoclonal Antibody Conjugates in Cancer Treatment: Insights from Randomised Clinical Trials.",
        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Despite the development of advanced cancer therapies, achieving cancer eradication remains challenging. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is an innovative approach that combines radionuclides with monoclonal antibodies targeting tumour-associated antigens or those expressed by the tumour microenvironment. Over the past two decades, RIT has been extensively researched, along with two RIT products-<sup>90</sup>Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and <sup>131</sup>I-tositumomab. However, despite its demonstrated efficacy in non-solid tumours, RIT's clinical use remains limited, and its effectiveness in solid tumours is inconclusive. This study aimed to analyse randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the overall clinical effectiveness of RIT across different cancer types and its impact on treatment outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar was conducted from January 2000 to October 2024 in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and the PICOS framework. Studies were included if they were RCTs evaluating RIT for cancer treatment and reported treatment outcomes such as overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease-free survival, or time to progression (TTP). Data extraction was performed using a standardised Excel form, and study quality was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for RCTs. A narrative synthesis of the data was complemented by meta-analyses where feasible, particularly for progression- and survival-related endpoints. <b>Results:</b> Out of 2241 records identified, 20 RCTs encompassing approximately 3562 patients were included. The majority of trials focused on non-solid tumours, particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), while a smaller subset evaluated solid tumours such as lung, pancreatic, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Most non-solid tumour studies employed <sup>90</sup>Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan or <sup>131</sup>I-tositumomab, targeting the CD20 antigen, whereas limited evidence exists for RIT efficacy in solid tumours. Meta-analysis of progression-related outcomes yielded a pooled hazard ratio (HR) of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39-0.59), indicating a 52% reduction in the risk of progression. In contrast, overall survival outcomes were more variable, with a pooled OS HR of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.60-1.07). Adverse events, predominantly haematological and nonhaematological toxicities, were common yet generally reversible. The findings suggest that RIT, especially when used as part of combination regimens, significantly improves treatment outcomes in non-solid tumours but has an inconsistent effect in solid tumour settings. <b>Conclusions:</b> The results underscore the clinical promise of RIT in treating non-solid tumours like NHL, where combination regimens yield superior outcomes compared to monotherapy. However, the inconclusive evidence in solid tumours highlights the need for further large-scale, well-designed RCTs to define the optimal use, dosing, and patient selection for RIT in these settings. Additionally, standardisation in outcome reporting and longer follow-up periods are essential for more accurate economic and clinical assessments. Overall, RIT represents a valuable therapeutic modality, yet its integration into cancer treatment regimens should be guided by further research aimed at mitigating toxicity and optimising combination strategies.",

        "abstract": "Backyard poultry farming is common in rural areas worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries, where approximately 80 % of rural households are involved. Effective biosecurity assessments are essential to prevent diseases and therefore, this study aimed to develop a risk-based weighted scoring system to evaluate biosecurity levels in backyard poultry households in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), as well as to describe its use in Bangladesh. A questionnaire was drafted with input from backyard poultry experts, followed by weights were attributed to the answers to obtain a weighted and risk-based questionnaire where scores represent the level of biosecurity measures. A score of 0 indicates absence of biosecurity measures, while 100 implies optimal biosecurity. The questionnaire was pretested with 20 households in Savar, Dhaka. Subsequently, 384 households were randomly selected from six districts in Bangladesh, based on the poultry population and consistent backyard poultry rearing. The scoring system is freely available online at https://biocheckgent.com/en/. External biosecurity (50 questions) was assessed in the following subcategories: purchase of eggs or day-old chicks, purchase of laying hens, depopulation and transport of poultry and poultry products, feed and water supply, visitors and farm personnel, manure and carcass removal, infrastructure and biological vectors of the farm, location of the farm. Internal biosecurity (13 questions) was subdivided in disease management and cleaning and disinfection. The average biosecurity scores for the external and internal categories were 30.3 % and 32.4 %, respectively. The two highest mean external biosecurity scores were obtained for depopulation and transport of poultry and poultry products (mean= 56.0 %) and manure and carcass removal (mean = 37.5 %) while the lowest means score was obtained for the category visitors and farm workers (mean = 12.4 %). In the internal biosecurity category, cleaning and disinfection had the highest mean score (34.1 %). Besides backyard production, small-scale commercial broiler production was present in 7 % of the visited households and the biosecurity score in these households was on average higher compared to those without commercial farming. This study reveals sub-optimal levels of biosecurity among backyard poultry in Bangladesh, as evaluated through the Biocheck.UGent scoring tool which has shown to be valuable for addressing biosecurity challenges in backyard production in low- and middle-income countries. The observed biosecurity gaps expose the poultry system to considerable risks of introduction and spread of infectious diseases.",

Antimicrobial resistance to the available therapeutics has prompted the search for new drug and vaccine targets against A. duodenale. Despite significant advances in vaccine development against A. duodenale, no commercial and FDA-approved vaccine exists to safeguard humans from infections caused by this pathogen. In this investigation, a stringent bioinformatics analysis identified 36 unique essential and host-interacting proteins. Based on their subcellular localization, 6 proteins located in the extracellular space and outer membrane were categorized as vaccine targets, while the remaining proteins were predicted to act as potential drug candidates. These vaccine candidates were further assessed for antigenicity, allergenicity, and physicochemical analysis to determine their suitability for the designing of a multi-epitope vaccine. Two candidate proteins were chosen as optimal targets in the development of vaccine design. The identified T- and B-cell epitopes from these proteins were then combined with appropriate linkers and adjuvants to design chimeric vaccine constructs aimed at inducing both cellular and humoral immune responses. Molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations, PCA analysis, DCCM analysis, and binding free energy calculations proved stable interactions of the designed vaccine with human immune cell receptors. Within a bacterial cloning system, the vaccine constructs demonstrated the ability to be cloned and expressed. The immunological stimulation elicited significant immunological responses to the proposed vaccine. Our investigation identified new therapeutic targets and developed a peptide-based multi-epitope vaccine against A. duodenale infection. Additional experimental verification will open up new therapeutic alternatives for this emerging resistant pathogen.",

Based on literature review, expert consultation and prior experience, we adopted the identification, sensitisation, involvement, and engagement (ISIE) framework of stakeholder engagement and process documentation. After identifying national and local level stakeholders via a power-interest mapping exercise, we sensitised them to the gaps in gynaecological health service delivery. High-power and high-interest stakeholders were involved and engaged in developing the EGS implementation package, which was then introduced in selected public health facilities and evaluated through implementation research. Acknowledging the urgent need for gynaecological health care services, the identified and sensitised stakeholders supported the development of the EGS implementation package. This resulted in the development and implementation of the EGS implementation package under the Government of Bangladesh's leadership, highlighting government ownership. These outcomes reflected the potential for scalability and sustainability of the package. However, stakeholder engagement remains a time and resource-intensive process that requires an innovative, research-backed approach with committed implementation. Our experience of using the ISIE framework showcased the potential of this framework in achieving sustainability and scalability at the national level. However, further initiatives from the government can ensure nationwide scale-up, setting an example for other lower and middle-income countries.",

        "abstract": "Timely initiation and adequate number of antenatal care (ANC) visits are crucial for ensuring the health and well-being of both pregnant women and their unborn children. Despite recent progress, Bangladesh continues to face challenges in achieving sustainable development goal (SDG-3) related to maternal and neonatal health. This study examines the factors contributing to delayed initiation and a low number of ANC visits, while also evaluating the association between the timing and overall number of ANC visits. Nationally representative data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys (BDHS) conducted in 2007 (n = 3050) and 2017-18 (n = 4544) on women aged 15-49 years. We investigated two binary outcome variables: late ANC, defined as the initiation of ANC visits after 12 weeks of gestation, and low ANC, defined as having less than four ANC visits. Geospatial mapping was employed to visualize spatial patterns, followed by survey-weighted logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with late initiation of ANC and low ANC visit frequency. Additionally, classification tree analysis was utilized to explore interactions between predictors and outcomes. Logistic regression modeling revealed that late ANC was associated with a more than fourfold increase in the odds of having fewer than four ANC visits (AOR: 4.60 [95% CI: 3.69-5.73] in 2007 and AOR: 4.68 [95% CI: 4.00-5.48] in 2017-18). Classification tree analysis further confirmed that late ANC initiation was the most critical predictor of total number of ANC attendance, underscoring the necessity of early ANC initiation to ensure sufficient coverage. Early initiation of ANC is essential for achieving an adequate number of ANC visits. Notably, the same set of sociodemographic factors remained statistically significant predictors in both 2007 and 2017, highlighting the persistent nature of these disparities and underscoring the urgent need for targeted policies and health interventions.",

        "abstract": "Clinical mastitis (CM) remains a critical challenge in dairy production, exacerbated by the global rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, which threatens herd health and productivity. This study pioneers a dual genomic-computational strategy to develop bacteriocin-based therapeutics-a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics-by targeting conserved virulence mechanisms in CM-causing pathogens. We aimed to (i) identify essential core proteins in CM-causing pathogens of dairy cows using the genomic approach; and (ii) assess the efficacy of bacteriocin peptides (BPs) as novel therapeutic agents targeting the selected core proteins for sustainable management of mastitis. Through pan-genomic analysis of 16 clinically relevant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. warneri, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. uberis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. asiatica, we identified 65 evolutionarily conserved core proteins. Prioritization based on essentiality, virulence, and resistance potential revealed Rho (transcription termination factor) and HupB (nucleoid-associated protein) as high-value therapeutic targets due to their critical roles in bacterial survival and pathogenicity. A computational screen of 70 BPs identified 14 candidates with high binding affinity for both Rho and HupB proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that BP8, a novel dual-action bacteriocin, competitively inhibits Rho-mediated transcription termination and disrupts HupB-DNA interactions, effectively crippling bacterial replication and virulence. BP8 exhibited superior structural stability and binding efficacy compared to other candidates, positioning it as a potent broad-spectrum agent against diverse CM pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. Our study underscores the untapped potential of bacteriocins in veterinary medicine, offering a sustainable solution to mitigate antibiotic overuse and resistance. The computational validation of BP8 provides a foundational framework for developing targeted therapies, with implications for reducing dairy industry losses and improving animal welfare. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are warranted to translate these insights into practical therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "A previous RNA-Seq study revealed that the transcript abundance of specificity protein 1 (SP1) was significantly higher in Day 7 bovine blastocysts compared to conceptuses on Days 10, 13, 16, and 19, suggesting a stage-specific role in early bovine embryo development. The present study aimed to characterize the mRNA expression of SP1 and associated candidate genes (ACSS1, C1QBP, ATF3, MAT2A, and POLD1) during early bovine embryo development from the 2-cell to blastocyst stage. Further, the effects of SP1 inhibition on embryo development were evaluated by culturing embryos with the SP1 inhibitor, mithramycin A (MT) at varying concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100, and 1000 nM). As further validation, we examined expression of SP1 and associated genes by interrogating transcriptomic data from Day 4 (16-cell stage) embryos cultured in vitro or in vivo in the oviducts of lactating or nonlactating dairy cows. The relative abundance of SP1 peaked at the time of embryonic genome activation, being higher (P < 0.05) in 8- and 16-cell embryos compared to the 2-cell stage, and decreasing thereafter (at the morula and blastocyst stages). Similarly, transcript abundance for most of the selected candidate genes involved in the SP1 network were upregulated (P < 0.05) at the 8- and 16-cell stage, but not at other stages investigated. Inhibition of SP1 with MT did not affect embryo development up to the 8-cell stage but reduced (P < 0.05) the proportion of embryos reaching the 16-cell and blastocyst stages in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, blastocysts produced in the presence of MT contained fewer (P < 0.05) cells than blastocysts developed without MT. Expression of SP1 and associated genes in 16-cell stage (Day 4) embryos produced either in vitro or in vivo was higher (P < 0.05) compared to in vitro-produced 2- to 4- cell stage (Day 2) embryos. These findings suggest an essential role of SP1 during early embryo development, particularly around the time of embryonic genomic activation.",

        "abstract": "Tissue observation has traditionally been limited to obtaining two-dimensional information from thinly sliced tissues due to issues with light transmission and antibody penetration. In recent years, three-dimensional tissue observation methods combining tissue clearing and deep immunostaining methods have been reported. However, due to the significantly different procedures in these methods from conventional immunostaining methods and the requirement for an expensive and specialized light-sheet microscope for tissue observation, the widespread adoption of these methods has been limited. To promote the shift from the current two-dimensional tissue observation to three-dimensional tissue observation using a combination of tissue clearing and immunostaining, it is essential to establish a simple and easy-to-implement protocol that is compatible with observation using a confocal microscope, which is available in many facilities. In this study, we first examined the effects of tissue clearing and staining conditions of immunostaining with thin tissue slices. We showed that CUBIC-L enhances immunolabeling without diminishing the immunoreactivity of antigens. We also showed that high detergent concentrations enhance the intensity of immunoreactivity and that a two-step staining procedure is suitable for our proposed protocol. Based on the results, we propose a simple protocol that can be easily adapted from conventional methods and is compatible with confocal microscopes. The results of this study are expected to facilitate a shift from traditional methods to three-dimensional tissue observation techniques that combine tissue clearing and immunostaining, contributing to the broader adoption of three-dimensional tissue observation.",

        "abstract": "In Bangladesh, dengue fever and influenza pose serious public health risks due to their high rates of morbidity and fatality. Frequent outbreaks have been caused by dengue, a virus spread by mosquitoes that causes flu-like symptoms, particularly during the monsoon season. Another infectious respiratory illness that varies every year is influenza. Both illnesses frequently co-circulate in tropical areas like Bangladesh, raising the possibility of co-infection and putting vulnerable groups at higher risk. The purpose of the article is to explore the effects of dengue and influenza co-infection in Bangladesh, looking at present issues and possible solutions to this dual health burden. This perspective piece gathers data from authoritative sources, including PubMed, the World Health Organization, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Bangladesh, and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Relevant literature on dengue and influenza incidence, control measures, and co-infection dynamics was reviewed. In Bangladesh, dengue incidence are still on the rise, while influenza infections have climbed, especially during the winter. The country's healthcare system may be overburdened by the simultaneous spread of both diseases, particularly if dengue rates keep rising and influenza cases rise. To lessen the effects of these illnesses, effective community awareness campaigns, vector control initiatives, and early diagnosis techniques are crucial. Bangladesh must emphasize increased preventative and preparation measures, such as better monitoring, public health communication, and vaccine development research, given the twin danger posed by dengue and influenza. To lower the likelihood of co-infection and avert future public health emergencies, coordinated actions are essential.",

This umbrella review aimed to synthesize existing systematic reviews on AI applications in nursing care, providing a comprehensive analysis of its benefits, challenges, and ethical implications. By consolidating findings from multiple sources, this review seeks to offer evidence-based insights to guide the effective and responsible integration of AI in nursing practice. A systematic umbrella review approach was employed following PRISMA guidelines. Multiple databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore, were searched for review articles published between 2015 and 2024. Findings were synthesized thematically to identify key trends, benefits, limitations, and research gaps. This review synthesized 13 studies, emphasizing AI's impact on clinical decision support, patient monitoring, nursing education, and workflow optimization. AI enhances early disease detection, minimizes diagnostic errors, and automates documentation, improving efficiency. However, data privacy risks, biases, ethical concerns, and limited AI literacy hinder integration. AI presents significant opportunities for improving nursing care, yet its successful implementation requires addressing ethical, legal, and practical challenges. Adequate AI training, robust data governance frameworks, and policies ensuring responsible AI use are essential for its integration into nursing practice.

This review examines the neurobiological mechanisms through which oxytocin influences mental health and its therapeutic potential in conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression. Oxytocin enhances social bonding, trust, and empathy by modulating neural circuits linked to social interactions. Studies indicate that oxytocin's ability to regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis plays a vital role in stress response and emotional regulation. Therapeutic applications, particularly intranasal administration of oxytocin, have shown promise in alleviating symptoms and improving patient outcomes. However, personalized approaches are essential to optimize treatment effectiveness. Despite its potential, challenges remain in understanding the mechanisms underlying its effects and identifying the patient populations that would benefit most from such therapies.

        "abstract": "Alleviating suffering and preserving dignity are essential components of healthcare. Patients in need of palliative care often require opioid medication to relieve breathlessness and pain. However, a lack of access to essential opioids, particularly morphine, remains a major challenge in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This is notably critical in the humanitarian context. We conducted two case studies to identify the barriers and facilitators of access to opioids, particularly morphine, for palliative care patients in humanitarian settings while exploring humanitarian healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences with opioids. Two case studies were conducted based on two Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) projects which integrated palliative care: advanced HIV care in Patna, Bihar, India, and paediatric and neonatal care in the refugee context in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Six semi-structured interviews were conducted with key MSF healthcare professionals. Interviews were conducted in English, video- and/or audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were coded and analysed using the grounded theory approach. Several barriers impeding access to and use of essential opioids in palliative care were reported by the participants. These included limited availability, accessibility obstacles, sociocultural challenges such as low awareness and misconceptions, lack of healthcare providers' training on opioid use, and burdensome regulatory processes. Most participants reported that clinical guidelines, familiarity with the use of opioids and interdisciplinary teamwork were important facilitators of opioid prescribing. Participants expressed the urgency for further educational and advocacy initiatives to improve access to essential opioids for patients requiring palliative care. Humanitarian healthcare workers face multiple challenges, leading to inadequate access to essential opioid medication, which undermines effective palliative care delivery. Further training on the use of opioids and strong advocacy efforts led by humanitarian organizations and the medical community are critical to improving access to these essential medicines for the relief of pain and suffering.",

        "title": "The Cost and Cost-Effectiveness of Childbirth Settings: A Systematic Review.",
        "abstract": "To sustain positive progress toward sustainable development goals as envisioned in goal 3 and beyond, safe and affordable care during pregnancy and birth for women, their families, and health facilities and professionals is essential. In this systematic review, we report the best available evidence regarding the cost and cost-effectiveness of birth in various settings, including hospitals, birth centres, and homes for women at low risk of complications from high-, middle-, and low-income countries. We conducted a systematic review of cost and economic evaluation papers, following the comprehensive search of online databases, including Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar, and grey literature, using predetermined search strategies. Both partial and full economic evaluation studies were included, and we appraised them using Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI's) critical appraisal checklists for economic evaluation studies. Although we attempted to pool total incremental net benefit, the results were synthesised narratively without a meta-analysis due to the high heterogeneity between primary studies. From 2307 identified studies, 11 studies (13 country level records from 11 countries) were included. Both direct and indirect costs of childbirth at home, midwife-led birth units (MLBUs), and hospitals were reported. Ten studies showed that births in MLBUs were less costly than hospital births, while home births were also reported to be less costly than hospital births in seven studies. Regarding cost-effectiveness, in Bangladesh, MLBUs generally showed better outcomes at lower costs than hospital births, while one site had higher costs. In Pakistan and Uganda, MLBUs displayed mixed results, with some being cost-effective and others more costly with poorer outcomes. In the Netherlands, MLBUs were less costly but had poorer outcomes, whereas home births were less costly and more effective. In Belgium, MLBUs were less costly but less effective in reducing caesarean and instrumental births, though they did reduce epidural analgesia use cost-effectively. Most studies found that births in MLBUs and at home were less costly than births in hospital. There is the potential for these settings to provide a cost-effective option for women through reduced intervention rates and favourable outcomes in high-income countries and could offer birthing options to women in low- and middle-income countries that includes care by skilled maternity practitioners in potentially more affordable settings.",

        "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by systemic involvement, inflammation, and the destruction of synovial joints. RA can be categorized as anti-citrullinated protein antibodies-positive or negative based on genetic risk factors and autoantibodies. This review systematically sourced articles related to RA, phytocompounds, signaling pathways, and clinical insights from primary medical databases, including Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science. This review explores the therapeutic potential of phytocompounds in treating RA by targeting key inflammation and immunological response signaling pathways. Phytocompounds such as curcumin, resveratrol, and flavonoids alter essential molecular pathways in RA pathophysiology, including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, mitogen-activated protein kinases, janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription, and the inflammasome. These substances possess pro-resolving, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant properties, which enhance their therapeutic efficacy. Alternative medicine, including dietary, herbal, and nutritional supplements, may help reduce RA symptoms. In vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of these treatments. Phytocompounds have potential as a treatment for RA by altering signaling pathways, reducing oxidative stress, and protecting cartilage and bone. However, few clinical trials confirm its long-term safety, bioavailability, and effectiveness. Further clinical trials and translational research are needed to validate the effectiveness, safety, and pharmacokinetics of phytocompounds, while identifying novel plant-derived bioactive chemicals could improve patient outcomes.",

        "title": "STAT3 Signaling Pathway in Health and Disease.",
        "abstract": "Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a critical transcription factor involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes. While STAT3 plays an essential role in homeostasis, its persistent activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, particularly cancer, bone-related diseases, autoimmune disorders, inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative conditions. The interleukin-6/Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT3 signaling axis is central to STAT3 activation, influencing tumor microenvironment remodeling, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and therapy resistance. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms underlying dysregulated STAT3 signaling in disease progression remain incompletely understood, and no United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA)-approved direct STAT3 inhibitors currently exist. This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of STAT3's role in health and disease, emphasizing its involvement in cancer stem cell maintenance, metastasis, inflammation, and drug resistance. We systematically discuss therapeutic strategies, including JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib), Src Homology 2 domain inhibitors (S3I-201, STATTIC), antisense oligonucleotides (AZD9150), and nanomedicine-based drug delivery systems, which enhance specificity and bioavailability while reducing toxicity. By integrating molecular mechanisms, disease pathology, and emerging therapeutic interventions, this review fills a critical knowledge gap in STAT3-targeted therapy. Our insights into STAT3 signaling crosstalk, epigenetic regulation, and resistance mechanisms offer a foundation for developing next-generation STAT3 inhibitors with greater clinical efficacy and translational potential.",

        "abstract": "Depression and anxiety are common mental health issues globally, yet limited research has focused on job seekers in Bangladesh. This study examines the prevalence and associated factors of depression and anxiety symptoms among Bangladeshi graduates seeking employment. A cross-sectional study was conducted among graduates from two public universities in Bangladesh, using face-to-face interviews and a semi-structured questionnaire. Data were collected between March and April 2024 through convenience sampling. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used for analysis with SPSS software. Among the participants, 46.8% experienced depressive symptoms and 67.8% had anxiety symptoms, with 42.3% experiencing both. Factors associated with a reduced risk of depressive symptoms included being a first child (OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.25-0.93, <i>p</i> = 0.031) and exam satisfaction (OR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.12-0.39, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Lower symptoms of anxiety were associated with being male (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.25-0.80, <i>p</i> = 0.007), first-born status (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.22-0.92, <i>p</i> = 0.030), financial contribution to family (OR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.19-0.81, <i>p</i> = 0.011), over 12 months of preparation (OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.15-0.92, <i>p</i> = 0.034) and exam satisfaction (OR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.22-0.71, <i>p</i> = 0.002). Intentionally unemployed participants had a higher risk of anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.00-2.89, <i>p</i> = 0.046). This study reveals high rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms among job-seeking graduates in Bangladesh. Socio-demographic and job-related factors appear to significantly impact mental health, underscoring the need for a holistic approach to address these challenges. Targeted mental health interventions and increased public awareness are essential to support vulnerable groups in navigating the highly competitive job market.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing various fields, including scientific writing, which traditionally relies on human intellectual effort. This review article explores the evolving role of AI in scientific writing, highlighting its applications, challenges and ethical implications. The adoption of AI in scientific writing offers several key advantages that make it attractive to researchers. AI-powered tools are employed to scan large volumes of academic literature quickly and efficiently. AI writing assistants have become increasingly sophisticated in generating human-like text. AI-driven language models can help authors who are not native English speakers to produce high-quality, well-written manuscripts. Another significant benefit is the ability to handle large amounts of data efficiently. Moreover, AI tools reduce the risk of plagiarism by detecting unintentional similarities between newly drafted manuscripts and previously published work. AI systems are also being developed to assist with the peer-review process. Automated tools use AI to analyze manuscripts, checking for completeness, adherence to journal guidelines and even suggesting potential reviewers. Furthermore, AI aids in citation management by helping researchers organize and insert references correctly. Despite the benefits of AI in scientific writing, several ethical considerations and challenges accompany its adoption. A significant concern relates to the potential over-reliance on AI for generating text and performing critical analyses. Additionally, the question of authorship becomes increasingly complex with the involvement of AI in writing. Another significant issue concerns the potential for bias in AI-generated content. AI models are trained on vast amounts of data, which often reflect existing biases in published literature. This is particularly concerning in fields such as healthcare, where biased research could have serious consequences for patient care and treatment outcomes. Finally, the use of AI raises concerns about data privacy and security. As AI continues to evolve, it is essential for the scientific community to establish guidelines that ensure the responsible use of these tools, maximizing their benefits while mitigating potential risks.",

        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) exhibit significant global public health challenges due to the lack of effective treatments. Berberine (BBR), a natural alkaloid compound in various plants, has been recognized for its potential neuroprotective properties. This review explores the current understanding of BBR's mechanisms of action and its therapeutic potential in preventing and treating NDs such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. BBR's neuroprotective properties are attributed to its multifaceted actions, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and neurotrophic effects. In addition, BBR can influence many signaling pathways involved in neurodegeneration, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathways. Furthermore, BBR targets vital signaling pathways, including AMPK, PI3K/Akt, and MAPK, which are essential for developing NDs. In addition, BBR's efficacy in reducing neurodegenerative pathology and improving cognitive function has been demonstrated through preclinical studies using cellular and animal models. Clinical trials demonstrating BBR's therapeutic potential in NDs have yielded promising results, but further research is needed to confirm its safety and efficacy in humans.",

There is a need to review current evidence on antibiotic use, access, and AMR, in primary care across key countries. This narrative review analyzes publications from 2018 to 2024 regarding access, availability, and use of appropriate antibiotics. There were very few studies focussing on a lack of access to antibiotics in primary care. However, there was considerable evidence of high rates of inappropriate antibiotic use, including Watch antibiotics, typically for minor infections, across studied countries exacerbated by patient demand. The high costs of antibiotics in a number of LMICs impact on their use, resulting in short courses and sharing of antibiotics. This can contribute to AMR alongside the use of substandard and falsified antibiotics. Overall, limited implementation of national action plans, insufficient resources, and knowledge gaps affects sustainable development goals to provide routine access to safe, effective, and appropriate antibiotics. There is a clear need to focus health policy on the optimal use of essential AWaRe antibiotics in primary care settings to reduce AMR in LMICs.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh, a densely populated South Asian country, faces numerous challenges in its healthcare system. Given the population of almost 160 million, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive health policy. Despite the government's recent advancements in improving healthcare services, there is still a significant amount of work that need to be accomplished. In Bangladesh, individuals are required to cover 68.50% of the total expenses for therapy directly from their own funds. Healthcare seekers in Bangladesh encounter numerous obstacles as a result of the exorbitant cost of medical services, including expenses for prescription medications, treatment charges, and diagnostic examinations. Health insurance is essential for mitigating financial risk and plays a pivotal role in societal safety nets, bolstering public health and health care. Insufficient health care in low and middle-income nations results in a significant number of deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) underscores the significance of health financing in attaining universal coverage, emphasizing the necessity of generating revenue, accumulating funds, and allocating resources to guarantee access and quality in healthcare services. To summarize, the healthcare system in Bangladesh is confronted with significant issues that are worsened by the financial demands placed on its populace. Adopting universal health coverage might play a crucial role in promoting fair and equal access to health care, improving health results, and strengthening economic stability for the approximately 160 million individuals in the country.",

This qualitative study was conducted in southeast Bangladesh and included 12 individual in-depth interviews with physicians. Data were analyzed using applied thematic analysis, focusing on both the contributions and shortcomings of village doctors. Three themes emerged for positive contributions of village doctors: 1) provision of essential services and resources in isolated areas, 2) enhanced accessibility and familiarity with the community, and 3) active involvement in public health education. Five themes emerged related to the shortcomings and negative impacts of village doctors: 1) insufficient education and training, 2) use of inappropriate treatments, 3) inappropriate referrals, 4) misuse and overuse of antibiotics, and 5) prioritization of financial gain. This study sheds light on the complex interplay between formal and informal health care providers, emphasizing both the contributions and shortcomings of village doctors in rural health care settings.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh underwent four waves of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Analysing them is essential for understanding changes in viral behaviour, disease patterns, severity, and response to treatment. Nevertheless, data are scarce in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical manifestations; outcomes for therapy with oxygen, dexamethasone, and remdesivir; as well as the case fatality during the ancestral, alpha/beta, delta, and omicron-driven waves. We conducted an observational study at five hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with at least one dedicated COVID-19 unit for treating patients that followed national guidelines between November 2020 and February 2022. We collected data prospectively between 1 July 2021 and 30 September 2021 (delta) and retrospectively from 1 November 2020 to 4 March 2021 (ancestral), 5 March 2021 to 30 May 2021 (alpha/beta), and 1 January 2022 to 28 February 2022 (omicron), with the periods representing distinct waves of COVID-19. The primary outcome was 30-day case fatality across the waves. We used multivariable robust Poisson regression models with robust variance to estimate the 30-day case fatality risk ratio during various waves. Among 966 participants, the rate of 30-day case fatality was comparable across different variants. However, the proportions of patients with fever (P < 0.001), cough (P < 0.001), breathing difficulty (P < 0.001), nausea (P < 0.001), fatigue (P < 0.001), headache (P < 0.001), diarrhoea (P < 0.001), loss of smell (P < 0.001), runny nose (P < 0.001), and chest pain (P = 0.001) were smaller during the omicron wave than the other three waves. After adjusting for potential confounders, the multivariable model showed that the likelihood of case fatality was significantly associated with age (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) = 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.07); hypoxaemia (aRR = 5.29; 95% CI = 1.58-17.7); critical disease (aRR = 6.45; 95% CI = 1.89-21.99), and modified early warning score ≥4 (aRR = 2.58; 95% CI = 1.71-3.88). We observed an 85% (aRR = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.03-0.72) reduction in case fatality among patients with any oxygen (L/min) compared to those without oxygen. However, individuals requiring ≥15 L/min of oxygen showed a significantly higher case fatality compared to those needing <15 L/min oxygen (aRR = 5.63; 95% CI = 2.68-11.81 for ancestral variant, aRR = 2.83; 95% CI = 1.25-6.41 for alpha/beta variant, aRR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.56-4.77 for delta variant, aRR = 2.84; 95% CI = 1.56-5.16 for omicron variant). Remdesivir was associated with an increased case fatality during alpha/beta (aRR = 6.96; 95% CI = 1.54-31.43), delta (aRR = 4.13; 95% CI = 1.17-14.58), and omicron waves (aRR = 8.89; 95% CI = 2.46-32.13) compared to the ancestral wave. Dexamethasone administered during admission did not have any significant association with death (P = 0.239) in the entire cohort. However, dexamethasone reduced case fatality by 78% among the moderate to severe COVID-19 subgroup. We observed a 37% reduction in case fatality among vaccinated participants compared to those without vaccination (aRR = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.40-0.99). Our study provides insights into the clinical patterns, treatment impact, and case fatality across various SARS-CoV-2 variants in resource-limited settings. The findings underscored the crucial role of oxygen therapy and vaccination in reducing COVID-19 case fatality. They also emphasise the necessity for continuous disease surveillance and highlight the importance of close monitoring of patients with higher oxygen requirements (≥15 L/min) due to their association with fatal outcomes, as well as the significance of sustaining vaccination efforts and the need for clinical trials of newer antivirals in the ongoing battle against COVID-19.",

However, its potential in arthritis management, combining in vitro, in vivo, and in silico studies; pharmacokinetics; and toxicity management, remains unexplored. This study investigated LIN's anti-arthritis activity through various approaches: in vitro (egg albumin test), in vivo (terpene oil, formaldehyde-induced, and Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA)-induced models), and in silico analyses. In the in vivo study, LIN (25, 50, and 75 mg/kg, p.o.) and the combination of LIN-50 with indomethacin (INDO, 10 mg/kg, p.o.) were evaluated. LIN-75 significantly reduced paw licking, inhibited paw edema in the terpene oil and formaldehyde-induced models, and showed significant inhibition in the FCA-induced arthritis model. The combination therapy of LIN-50 + INDO-10 demonstrated enhanced anti-arthritis activity compared to individual treatments. In the in vitro egg albumin test, LIN-75 exhibited the highest membrane-stabilizing activity, and its combination with INDO-10 resulted in a synergistic effect. In silico studies revealed significant binding affinities of LIN with COX-1, COX-2, and TNF-α (-5.5, -5.1, and -5.0 kcal/mol, respectively), suggesting its potential mechanism of action. Additionally, LIN showed favorable pharmacokinetics with lower toxicity than INDO. In conclusion, LIN exhibited dose-dependent anti-arthritic effects across various models, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Its efficacy suggests promising clinical relevance, warranting further research on its pharmacokinetics, toxicity management, and clinical applicability to fully establish its therapeutic benefits.",

        "abstract": "Despite completing the COVID-19 vaccination series, healthcare workers (HCWs) remain at an elevated risk of re-infection. Booster uptake, though essential for this group, remains poorly characterized among Bangladeshi HCWs. This study identified the prevalence and driving factors behind booster hesitancy among Bangladeshi HCWs, providing valuable insights for targeted interventions. From December 2022 to June 2023, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among 1772 HCWs enrolled from 20 healthcare facilities of all tiers purposively selected across four administrative divisions of Bangladesh. We collected information through face-to-face interviews regarding their sociodemographic, pre-existing, and currently existing medical conditions, COVID-19 vaccination status, and their intention, hesitancy, and willingness to receive future booster doses. We used a multivariable logistic regression model to analyze factors associated with booster hesitancy. Odd's ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated for each factor, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Of the 1772 HCWs interviewed in our study, 49% (879) were nurses [median age 36 years (IQR: 30.0-46.0)]; 69% were female. Among the respondents, 94% (1667) were willing to take a booster, and 6% (105) showed hesitancy. Safety concerns, especially regarding potential side effects post-booster administration (86%), emerged as the leading cause of booster hesitancy among healthcare workers. Our multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that support staff, compared to physicians, were the most hesitant to receive any additional booster dose (aOR 4.68, 95% CI: 1.56-9.03; p=0.006). Compared to rural residency, HCWs with an urban residency type were also more reluctant to receive booster doses (aOR 4.45, 95% CI: 2.03-9.73; p < 0.001). Concerns about side effects following booster administration were the primary driver of hesitancy in our study. Targeted interventions focusing on education and addressing these anxieties-supported by evidence-based communication strategies-could play a crucial role in improving booster acceptance and safeguarding this vulnerable workforce.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining a healthy diet is essential for both physical and mental well-being. This study investigated the association of mental health status with perceived barriers to maintaining healthy diets among Bangladeshi adults. This cross-sectional study was conducted between January to June 2023 in Bangladesh. A total of 400 adults aged between 18 and 60 years who reside in Dhaka, Chattogram, and Gazipur cities were recruited using a multistage sampling technique. A questionnaire consisting of 12 questions adapted from previous literature was used to assess barriers to healthy diets. Mental health status was measured using the validated DASS-21 scale. A quantile regression-based approach was used to ascertain the association between mental health status and barriers to healthy diets. The five most frequently reported barriers to a healthy diet were the use of junk food as a reward or treat (56.25%), difficulty in controlling eating habits when with friends (56%), the cost of healthy food (44.5%), difficulty in taking healthy food at work (46.5%), and difficult to stay motivated to eat healthy food (25%). The study found that gender, marital status, living arrangement, working hours, and family monthly income were significantly associated with perceived barriers to healthy diets. Mental health status was observed to be associated with barriers to healthy diet scores. Depression (<i>β</i> =0.34, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.51) and anxiety (β =0.14, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.28) were significantly associated with perceived barrier scores at the 50th quantile. Stress was also significantly associated with perceived barrier scores at the 10th (<i>β</i> =0.18, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.27) and the 25th quantiles (β =0.12, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.21). In light of the findings, it is imperative to prioritize the advocacy of policies that integrate mental health services and stress management strategies into public health initiatives.",

        "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is increasing globally and regionally, posing a significant public health concern. This study aimed to assess knowledge and attitude toward antibiotic use and the prevalence of self-medication and its association with the knowledge and attitude toward antibiotic use and resistance among private university teachers in Bangladesh. This quantitative, cross-sectional study utilized a convenience sampling technique and included 509 respondents. All data were collected using both face-to-face and online versions. Data were collected through both face-to-face and online surveys with all questions in a closed-ended format. Data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS (version 20), employing frequency analysis, chi-squared tests, and logistic regression. Among the respondents, 47.9% demonstrated high knowledge of antibiotic use and resistance. Only 19.3% showed a strong positive attitude toward antibiotic use and resistance. Self-medication with antibiotics was reported by 29.0% of respondents. Logistic regression analysis revealed that female participants were 5.02 times more knowledgeable about antibiotic use and resistance than male participants (95% CI: 2.72-9.91; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Additionally, respondents over 40 years old had a 3.71 times higher attitude toward antibiotic use and resistance than those aged 30 or below (95% CI: 1.98-7.06; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Females were 6.79 times more likely to self-medicate with antibiotics compared to males (95% CI: 3.67-13.43), and respondents aged 31-40 were 3.91 times more likely to practice self-medication than other age groups (95% CI: 1.07-3.86). Furthermore, participants with low knowledge and a low attitude toward antibiotic use and resistance were 3.87 times and 4.26 times more likely to self-meditate, respectively, than those who had high knowledge and attitude scores (95% CI: 2.00-5.70 and 95% CI: 1.99-5.12). To combat antibiotic resistance, campaigns and seminars on responsible antibiotic use should be held at university level. Additionally, enforcement of laws prohibiting unnecessary antibiotic sales in retail pharmacies is essential.",

        "abstract": "A critical predictive marker for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy is programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). This paper explores a novel automated framework using deep learning to accurately evaluate PD-L1 expression from whole slide images (WSIs) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), aiming to improve the precision and consistency of Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) evaluation, which is essential for determining patient eligibility for immunotherapy. Automating TPS evaluation can enhance accuracy and consistency while reducing pathologists' workload. The proposed automated framework encompasses three stages: identifying tumor patches, segmenting tumor areas, and detecting cell nuclei within these areas, followed by estimating the TPS based on the ratio of positively stained to total viable tumor cells. This study utilized a Reference Medicine (Phoenix, Arizona) dataset containing 66 NSCLC tissue samples, adopting a hybrid human-machine approach for annotating extensive WSIs. Patches of size 1000x1000 pixels were generated to train classification models such as EfficientNet, Inception, and Vision Transformer models. Additionally, segmentation performance was evaluated across various UNet and DeepLabV3 architectures, and the pre-trained StarDist model was employed for nuclei detection, replacing traditional watershed techniques. PD-L1 expression was categorized into three levels based on TPS: negative expression (TPS < 1%), low expression (TPS 1-49%), and high expression (TPS ≥ 50%). The Vision Transformer-based model excelled in classification, achieving an F1-score of 97.54%, while the modified DeepLabV3+ model led in segmentation, attaining a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 83.47%. The TPS predicted by the framework closely correlated with the pathologist's TPS at 0.9635, and the framework's three-level classification F1-score was 93.89%. The proposed deep learning framework for automatically evaluating the TPS of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC demonstrated promising performance. This framework presents a potential tool that could produce clinically significant results more efficiently and cost-effectively.",

        "title": "Disease Prevalence, Usage of Aquaculture Medicinal Products and Their Sustainable Alternatives in Freshwater Aquaculture of North-Central Bangladesh.",
        "abstract": "The use and abuse of aquaculture medicinal products (AMPs) has increased throughout the globe to enhance fish production and maximize profits. This study aimed to investigate the status of disease prevalence and usage of AMPs in aquaculture operations in North-Central Bangladesh, a region famous for its significant carp and catfish production within the Asian subcontinent. Farmers in this area are recognized for their innovative approaches to aquaculture. Data were collected through pretested questionnaire interviews and participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tools. Among the 90 surveyed grow-out farmers, the majority practiced mixed cultures of carps, Nile tilapia and catfish (primarily Pangasius) where diseases such as epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS), saprolegniasis, streptococcosis, tail and fin rot and bacillary necrosis were common. Despite the widespread use of AMPs, their efficacy is often limited, and their overuse can contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and environmental pollution. Additionally, the extra-label drug use (ELDU) has become an issue that results in controversial application of drugs by fish farmers. All together 142 AMPs of different groups were marketed by 24 companies, including antibiotics, disinfectants, nutritional supplements, probiotics, gas remover and salt. Among these, 3 groups of antibiotics with 11 active ingredients were identified, sold under 17 trade names in drug retail outlets. These antibiotics, originally intended for veterinary or poultry use, were often misapplied in aquaculture, raising concerns about ELDU practices. Due to the limited efficacy of many of these antibiotics, farmers adopted alternative approaches such as in-pond probiotics and fermented products. It was revealed that 12% (11 out of 90) of the farmers were using these alternatives that led to approximately 20% approved fish growth with a cost reduction up to 30% compared to the conventional culture cycles. Farmers also reported a reduction in disease outbreaks in ponds managed with these alternatives. Promotion of sustainable and responsible practices is essential for the long-term growth of aquaculture industry. It is expected that the use of probiotics and fermented products can reduce the reliance on conventional AMPs, thereby contributing to enhanced food security and economic development in Bangladesh.",

The study aimed to understand the prevalence and factors associated with malnutrition among patients with cancer. This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of malnutrition among patients with cancer and its relationship with sociodemographic status and treatments. Patients' nutritional diagnosis was performed using the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) tool. The performance status (PS) was obtained from the scale developed by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Data were collected from two hospitals from January to March 2023. A χ<sup>2</sup> test and multinominal regression analysis were performed by SPSS V.25. Out of 275 patients, 164 (60%) were male, with the mean age of 49.54 years (SD 15.61). Of these, 184 patients (67%) were malnourished of whom 149 patients (54%) had moderate and 35 patients (13%) had severe malnutrition. Patients' age, sex, PS, cancer site, treatment modalities, duration and hospitalisation were significantly associated with nutritional status (p<0.05). Patients between the ages of 40 and 60 were 2.96 times more likely to be malnourished compared with those younger than 40 (adjusted odd ratio (AOR) 2.96; 95% CI 1.40 to 6.24). Female patients had 7.74 times higher risk of malnutrition compared with male patients (AOR 7.74; 95% CI 2.03 to 19.80).

The present study covers the various roles of ncRNAs, including circular RNAs (circRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and microRNAs (miR-NAs), that affect cancer properties. Oncogenesis, metastasis, and treatment resistance are all pro-cesses involving ncRNAs, which have tremendous potential as new therapeutic agents and tar-gets. The review covers the broad spectrum of ncRNAs in cancer biology, including their types and activities, epigenetic control, function in metastasis and angiogenesis, detection and profiling ap-proaches, potential as biomarkers, and therapeutic possibilities. Recent advancements in next-gener-ation sequencing and other molecular methods have helped us better understand how ncRNAs work and their potential therapeutic uses. However, there are still challenges to standardizing detection technologies and producing effective RNA-based therapeutics. Therefore, further studies are needed to solve important issues in this sector. Standardization efforts are also essential to developing iden-tical methods for ncRNA collection, quantification, and analysis throughout multiple laboratories and ensuring the findings are reliable and comparable. Large-scale, multi-recentre studies are required to verify the diagnostic usefulness of ncRNA biomarkers across a wide range of patient groups. Also, more detailed mechanistic knowledge is necessary for understanding the particular molecular mech-anisms by which ncRNAs affect cancer growth, metastasis, and treatment response. This review high-lights the complex relationships between ncRNAs and cancer biology and also focuses on their po-tential effect on cancer diagnosis and treatment. It also highlights the necessity for more studies to fully understand the therapeutic potential of ncRNAs in cancer. As studies advance, using ncRNA results in clinical practice might change cancer treatment by novel opportunities for specific therapy and personalized medicine.",

        "abstract": "Bangladesh has been experiencing a rapid demographic shift from the younger population to older adults, with the older adults facing significant challenges due to the absence of residential and formal home care models. This perspective aimed to evaluate the status of residential and formal home care models and propose potential strategies to improve elderly care in Bangladesh. This perspective utilized a narrative review approach to search existing literature on elderly care in Bangladesh on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. The perspective reviewed and presented the status of elderly care and identified gaps in residential and formal home care infrastructure by analyzing existing literature. In Bangladesh, there was no evidence found that any authority had ever initiated or evaluated residential and formal home care programs, showing systematic neglect that resulted in the suffering of older adults. The collapse of the traditional informal family care model, fueled by urban migration and shifting socioeconomic dynamics, has further isolated older adults, leaving them with considerable unmet care needs. The issue is being worsened by a high prevalence of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, as well as the collective inability to meet the growing demand for elderly care. Furthermore, limited access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas, emphasized the urgent need for comprehensive elderly care models in Bangladesh. The proposed strategies involve developing residential care facilities, probably on a small scale, and integrating formal home care services in Bangladesh. However, conducting preliminary investigations is essential, including investigating the model to be implemented, training caregivers, and establishing financial support programs and regulatory frameworks. Thus, the government and private sector organizations should collaborate to address these challenges of older adults in Bangladesh.",

Despite extensive research efforts, conventional treatment strategies primarily focus on symptom management, highlighting the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. This review explores the challenges of AD treatment and the integration of computational methodologies to advance therapeutic interventions. A comprehensive analysis of recent literature was conducted to elucidate the broad scope of Alzheimer's etiology and the limitations of conventional drug discovery approaches. Our findings underscore the critical role of computational models in elucidating disease mechanisms, identifying therapeutic targets, and expediting drug discovery. Through computational simulations, researchers can predict drug efficacy, optimize lead compounds, and facilitate personalized medicine approaches. Moreover, machine learning algorithms enhance early diagnosis and enable precision medicine strategies by analyzing multi-modal datasets. Case studies highlight the application of computational techniques in AD therapeutics, including the suppression of crucial proteins implicated in disease progression and the repurposing of existing drugs for AD management. Computational models elucidate the interplay between oxidative stress and neurodegeneration, offering insights into potential therapeutic interventions. Collaborative efforts between computational biologists, pharmacologists, and clinicians are essential to translate computational insights into clinically actionable interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and addressing the unmet medical needs of individuals affected by AD.

        "abstract": "Over the past two decades, numerous countries have enhanced their Universal Health Coverage (UHC), as indicated by the UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI), alongside a global reduction in the disease burden measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). This paper uses a cross-country panel of 190 countries from 2000 to 2019 to identify the association between UHC SCI and DALYs gain. We find that a one-unit increase in the UHC SCI was associated with a significant decrease in total DALYs. Furthermore, UHC SCI was mostly associated with lowering DALYs from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases but showed little to no significant association with non-communicable diseases or injuries. These results are robust to various robustness tests. Notable reasons include governments spending more on communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases than on non-communicable diseases and injuries, which is also the case for external aid. Our results also suggest that moving towards UHC helps lower-income countries more than higher-income countries, as developed nation-states have already established a well-functioning health system. Addressing non-communicable diseases and injuries will be essential to improve health outcomes and achieve SDGs in future.",

Total numbers and age-standardized rates per 100,000 population for MASLD prevalence, annual incidence, and YLDs were compared across regions and countries by age, sex, and sociodemographic index (SDI). Smoothing spline models were used to evaluate the relationship between the burden of MASLD and SDI. Estimates were reported with uncertainty intervals (UI). Globally, in 2021, the age-standardized rates per 100,000 population of point prevalence of MASLD were 15,018.1 cases (95% UI 13,756.5-16,361.4), annual incidence rates were 608.5 cases (598.8-617.7), and YLDs were 0.5 (0.3-0.8) years. MASLD point prevalence was higher in men than women (15,731.4 <i>vs.</i> 14,310.6 cases per 100,000 population). Prevalence peaked at ages 45-49 for men and 50-54 for women. Kuwait (32,312.2 cases per 100,000 people; 95% UI: 29,947.1-34,839.0), Egypt (31,668.8 cases per 100,000 people; 95% UI: 29,272.5-34,224.7), and Qatar (31,327.5 cases per 100,000 people; 95% UI: 29,078.5-33,790.9) had the highest prevalence rates in 2021. The largest increases in age-standardized point prevalence estimates from 2010 to 2021 were in China (16.9%, 95% UI 14.7%-18.9%), Sudan (13.3%, 95% UI 9.8%-16.7%) and India (13.2%, 95% UI 12.0%-14.4%). MASLD incidence varied with SDI, peaking at moderate SDI levels. MASLD is a global health concern, with the highest prevalence reported in Kuwait, Egypt, and Qatar. Raising awareness about risk factors and prevention is essential in every country, especially in China, Sudan and India, where disease incidence and prevalence are rapidly increasing. This research provides a comprehensive analysis of the global burden of MASLD, highlighting its rising prevalence and incidence, particularly in countries with varying sociodemographic indices. The findings are significant for both clinicians and policymakers, as they offer critical insights into the regional disparities in MASLD burden, which can inform targeted prevention and intervention strategies. However, the study's reliance on modeling and available data suggests cautious interpretation, and further research is needed to validate these findings in clinical and real-world settings.",

Anti-<i>Acanthamoeba</i> activities of 44 extracts from 5 plant species were determined. From 44 tested extracts, a chloroform extract of Kre bark showed the strongest anti-<i>Acanthamoeba</i> activities against both trophozoites and cysts, with MIC values of 32.25 and 62.50 μg/mL, respectively. Then, amebicidal and antiadhesion activities of Kre against <i>A. triangularis</i> were investigated. Kre reduced the growth by 3 logs within 8 h at 4 × MIC. Disruption of the cells with abnormal shapes was observed when trophozoites were treated with Kre. Trophozoites had lost their robust acanthopodia and began to shrink after treatment with Kre. Treated cysts exhibited wall disruption and dramatically showed forms of marked retraction. Treatment of Kre at 1/2 × MIC showed about 87% reduction in the trophozoite adhesion, while treatment at 2 × MIC exhibited a 59% reduction in the trophozoite adhesion to the plastic surface, compared with the control. Furthermore, 1 log cells/mL (90%) of the contact lens adhesive trophozoites were reduced and removed after treatment with Kre. Molecular docking indicated that E2N, the main compound in Kre, exhibited strong binding to the ligand binding sites at β-tubulin, with a binding energy of -7.01 kcal/mol and an inhibitory constant of 2.43-7.32 μM. E2N generated multiple connections via hydrogen, hydrophobic, ionic, and water bridge bonding and maintained these connections until the simulation finished, facilitating the creation of stable bindings with the β-tubulin protein as measured by molecular dynamics simulation. These findings suggest that Kre exhibits amebicidal and antiadhesion activities which could be used for the prevention of <i>A. triangularis</i> adhesion to contact lenses.",

        "abstract": "Human activities significantly influence the changes in wildlife habitats and biodiversity, highlighting the necessity to enhance public knowledge, perceptions, and practices (KPP) to mitigate their consequences. Previous research suggests that many people in Bangladesh do not consider wildlife and biodiversity conservation a crucial issue. However, enhancing their KPP could be essential in developing effective and sustainable conservation efforts in Bangladesh. So, the current study aimed to evaluate the public's KPP of wildlife conservation and biodiversity management in Bangladesh. A total of 3060 individuals' data were collected from various sociodemographic backgrounds using a structured questionnaire followed by statistical analyses including Pearson's chi-square, Spearman's correlation, and logistic regression analysis, which were performed to assess the correlations and trends among variables using STATA and SPSS. The results revealed a significant heterogeneity in KPP across different sociodemographic groups. Importantly, the younger respondents (ages 21-30) indicated a high level of KPP, and respondents without formal education and belonging to older ages demonstrated markedly low levels of KPP. In the country's divisional levels, respondents from Khulna and Rangpur revealed the highest and lowest KPP levels, respectively. Our study also revealed that students represented the major occupational demographic and displayed moderate levels of KPP. Notably, respondents highlighted the decline or absence of several wild animal species, including black bears, deer, vultures, wild cats, hanuman monkeys, and rhesus monkeys, from their local areas over the past decades. Public opinion on wildlife protection revealed 78.6% and 73.4% disapproving of hunting rejection and wildlife trading, respectively. Nonetheless, a lack of knowledge remained, as 16.89% of respondents were unaware of measures to alleviate human-wildlife conflict. The correlation analysis indicated a favorable association among KPP components, especially between knowledge and perception (correlation coefficient = 0.438), underscoring the essential influence of awareness on conservation actions. This study offers critical insights for developing interventions to enhance KPP among local communities and stakeholders, hence promoting sustainable wildlife conservation and biodiversity management in Bangladesh. Taken together, the findings provide baseline data for safeguarding biodiversity and fostering long-term wildlife sustainability in Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "The Common House Crow (Corvus splendens) exhibits remarkable ecological adaptability, enabling its rapid expansion across continents. However, despite its wide distribution, there is a need for genetic studies to clarify its evolutionary history and population structure. This research employs DNA barcoding, focusing on the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit I (Cox1), which is effective for species identification and phylogenetic analysis. Blood samples were collected from 70 C. splendens specimens across seven cities in Punjab, Pakistan: Lahore, Kasur, Sialkot, Narowal, Pakpattan, Gujranwala, and Bahawalpur. Genomic DNA extraction was performed, and a partial sequence of the COX1 gene was amplified using PCR techniques. Sequencing of the Cox1 marker from 10 randomly selected specimens revealed nine distinct genetic variants. Interspecific analysis positioned our C. splendens sequences alongside various Corvus species available in GenBank, while intraspecific analysis identified a total of 15 genetic variants. These variants showed nucleotide identity rates ranging from 98.7 to 99.8%, with genetic distances between 0.002 and 0.013. The analysis indicated that the C. splendens group consists of a single heterogeneous clade with variants from multiple countries, including Pakistan, Tanzania, Nepal, South Africa, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Kenya, Australia, and Singapore. This study significantly enhances our understanding of genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships within C. splendens populations, highlighting the necessity of genetic research to inform conservation strategies. Further research employing advanced molecular techniques and broader geographic sampling is essential to assess the genetic diversity and population dynamics of this adaptable species.",

        "abstract": "In the World Health Organization (WHO) geographical region of South-East Asia, the mental health burden of adolescents appears high. Addressing this burden requires development of mental health policies consistent with international standards to assist governance, resource allocation and delivery of mental healthcare effectively. The aim was to identify current national mental health policies/plans/programs/legislation in South-East Asia, assess compliance with international standards and review inclusion of adolescents in these documents. Searches were conducted on WHO MiNDbank, official government websites, Google and Google Scholar. Documents were compiled and screened, data were extracted and evaluated following WHO Guidelines on Monitoring and Evaluation of Mental Health Policies and Plans. Frequencies of checklist and subsection scores were calculated. Data were narratively synthesised. Fourteen mental health policies/plans/programs/legislation from 8 countries met inclusion criteria. Maldivian and Bangladeshi documents complied the greatest with WHO guidelines. All 8 countries considered adolescents to some extent in their documents. Only Indian documents consulted child health groups during policy development. Intra/Inter sectoral collaboration with child health divisions was highlighted in documents from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India and Maldives. Most South-East Asian nations had developed separate national mental health governance documents. However, their incorporation of adolescent mental health is rare and compliance with international standards were inconsistent. Binding mental health legislation separate from health legislation; inclusion of adolescents; addressing resource constraints; and guidelines for mental health policy development catered to low-and-middle-income countries are all essential to address the complex mental health needs of South-East Asian adolescents.",

        "abstract": "The human gut microbiota, a complex and diverse community of microorganisms, plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health by influencing various physiological processes, including digestion, immune function, and disease susceptibility. The balance between beneficial and harmful bacteria is essential for health, with dysbiosis - disruption of this balance - linked to numerous conditions such as metabolic disorders, autoimmune diseases, and cancers. This review highlights key genera such as <i>Enterococcus</i>, <i>Ruminococcus</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, <i>Firmicutes</i> (including <i>Clostridium</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>), and <i>Roseburia</i> due to their well-established roles in immune regulation and metabolic processes, but other bacteria, including <i>Clostridioides difficile</i>, <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, and <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i>, are also implicated in dysbiosis and various diseases. Pathogenic bacteria, including <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i>, contribute to inflammation and cancer progression by disrupting immune responses and damaging tissues. The potential for microbiota-based therapies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary interventions, to improve health outcomes is examined. Future research directions in the integration of multi-omics, the impact of diet and lifestyle on microbiota composition, and advancing microbiota engineering techniques are also discussed. Understanding the gut microbiota's role in health and disease is essential for formulating personalized, efficacious treatments and preventive strategies, thereby enhancing health outcomes and progressing microbiome research.",

Assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among hypertensive patients in Bangladesh can highlight the broad impacts of the condition on morbidity and mortality. Such insights are essential for developing targeted healthcare and prevention strategies to reduce complications, including heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. In this cross-sectional study, 5,086 hypertensive patients aged between 18 and 80 were recruited from 75 pharmacies in Bangladesh. We assessed the participants' health using the EQ-5D-5 L descriptive system and the EQ-VAS. Utility scores were calculated using the Indian EQ-5D-5 L value set. Regression models were employed to identify factors associated with overall HRQoL and individual health dimensions. Study participants were mean aged 52 years old, with average systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 140.79 mmHg and 85.98 mmHg, respectively. The average EQ-index and EQ-VAS score were 0.83 and 67.47, respectively. 39% reported difficulties with self-care, 43.5% had mobility problems, 80.6% had pain, and 61.2% had anxiety. HRQoL scores decreased significantly with age, according to the multilevel model. Higher education levels, however, were associated with better HRQoL scores. Male respondents reported fewer problems with mobility, self-care, activity, pain, and anxiety. A decrease in HRQoL scores was observed among older individuals, those without formal education, those in lower quintiles, those unemployed, and those with poor blood pressure control, obesity, or fasting glucose. Study findings indicate disparities in HRQoL based on age, gender, education, and socioeconomic status, highlighting the need for targeted policy interventions.",

This qualitative study aimed to investigate awareness, attitudes, and practices related to MHM among girls in the Haor region, particularly during floods. The study adopts a phenomenological approach, and data were collected using purposive sampling from 33 women aged 15 years and above who resided in the Haor region. Thematic analysis was employed to identify the patterns, themes, and subthemes within the qualitative data. The study reveals a significant lack of widespread knowledge about menstruation among girls in the Haor area, which is associated with unfavourable family and social attitudes, and stigma or taboos. Natural hazards, cultural barriers, access to the market, economic incapacity, and inadequate infrastructure make it very difficult to manage menstruation, which is especially aggravated during floods due to displacement and shelter on the roadside, primary schools, and other people's houses. This research emphasises the need for tailored MHM programmes from the government to address the unique challenges faced by women in Haor regions. Provision of sanitary napkins and essential medicines, maintaining stock in shelters, and equipping community clinics with MHM-related healthcare services are essential. Finally, NGOs should prioritise MH within their scope of work.",

Rapid and accurate diagnostic tools are essential for effective disease management and minimizing economic losses. Conventional diagnostic methods, such as PCR, virus isolation, and serological assays, are hindered by limitations in sensitivity, specificity, and turnaround time. In contrast, innovative biosensor platforms employing advanced detection mechanisms-including electrochemical, optical, and piezoelectric sensors-offer a transformative solution. These technologies provide portable, highly sensitive, and rapid diagnostic platforms for IBV detection. Beyond addressing the challenges of conventional methods, these biosensor-based approaches facilitate real-time monitoring and enhance disease surveillance.

        "abstract": "Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK), a pivotal signaling protein, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, such as cell growth, survival, and differentiation. There is currently a growing interest in MELK as a promising therapeutic target for multiple cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Exploring MELK as a target offers a prospective strategy to impede cancer progression and enhance the efficacy of conventional anticancer therapies. In this study, we employed a multistep docking procedure to evaluate the anticancer potential of phyto-compounds from the NPACT and PhytoHub databases targeting the MELK protein. A collection of 23 740 compounds underwent hierarchical multistep docking, accompanied by an analysis of binding interactions. The extensive analysis identified five compounds (PHUB000697, PHUB002010, NPACT00373, PHUB002005, and PHUB001739) as potent inhibitors of the MELK protein, exhibiting docking scores lower than -11 Kcal/mol, that is, -12.90, -12.00, -11.23, -11.19, and -11.09 Kcal/mol, respectively. PHUB000697 exhibited very crucial interactions with Gly20, Lys40, Cys89, and Glu93 (2.74 Å). To evaluate the stability of protein-ligand interactions in dynamic states, 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted using the entire trajectory, revealing a substantial binding affinity for all identified compounds toward the MELK protein. Consequently, these five compounds emerge as promising candidates for future drug development targeting the MELK protein in treating TNBC. However, experimental assessment is essential to understand the molecular interaction mechanisms better. We are aiming to report a few in vitro and in vivo studies on these compounds to validate the computational results.",

This study aimed to assess the extent of research involvement and the factors influencing it among undergraduate medical students in Bangladesh. A multi-center cross-sectional study involving 2864 medical students from both public and private medical colleges was conducted between June and December 2023. Data on demographics, research involvement, participation in research training, future career aspirations in research, and obstacles encountered by students were collected. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 25. The mean age of the students was 21.8 ± 1.8 (SD) years, with the majority being female (61.8%). Overall, 21.5% (n = 617) were actively participating in research beyond academic activities. Approximately 7% (n = 205) had undergone formal research training, and 6.5% (n = 187) had experience in publications in peer-reviewed journals as first authors or coauthors. A total of 45.5% of the students faced multiple challenges during participating in research, with the two most difficult tasks being designing a study (26.7%) and data collection and recruitment of study participants (19.6%). Almost half of the students (47.2%, n = 1352) showed an interest in pursuing a research career in the near future. The primary barriers preventing students from choosing a future research career were insufficient mentorship (16.3%), the perception of a lengthy career path (17.2%), and limited funding opportunities (15.9%). Factors that significantly encouraged research involvement included being male (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.8), studying in the senior academic phase (aOR 3.9, 95% CI: 2.7-5.6), previous education from an English-medium educational institute (aOR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2-2.2), and encouragement from faculty (aOR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.7). The proportion of research participation among the students was relatively low. To promote research engagement among undergraduate medical students in Bangladesh, comprehensive policy formulation and strong commitment at the highest levels are essential. Integrating national research policy into the curriculum could serve as a strategic measure for achieving this objective.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a critical global challenge in the 21st century, validating Sir Alexander Fleming's warning about the misuse of antibiotics leading to resistant microbes. With a dwindling arsenal of effective antibiotics, it is imperative to concentrate on alternative antimicrobial strategies. Previous studies have not comprehensively discussed the advantages and limitations of various strategies, including bacteriophage therapy, probiotics, immunotherapies, photodynamic therapy, essential oils, nanoparticles and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) within a single review. This review addresses that gap by providing an overview of these various non-antibiotic antimicrobial strategies, highlighting their pros and cons, with a particular emphasis on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). We explore the mechanism of action of AMPs against bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. While these peptides hold significant promise, their application in mainstream drug development is hindered by challenges such as low bioavailability and potential toxicity. However, advancements in peptide engineering and chemical modifications offer solutions to enhance their clinical utility. Additionally, this review presents updates on strategies aimed at improving the cost, stability and selective toxicity of AMPs through the development of peptidomimetics. These molecules have demonstrated effective activity against a broad range of pathogens, making them valuable candidates for integration into surface coatings to prevent device-associated infections. Furthermore, we discuss various approaches for attaching and functionalising these peptides on surfaces. Finally, we recommend comprehensive in vivo studies to evaluate the efficacy of AMPs and their mimetics, investigate their synergistic combinations with other molecules and assess their potential as coatings for medical devices.",

        "abstract": "Explore humanitarian healthcare professionals' (HCPs) perceptions about implementing children's palliative care and to identify their educational needs and challenges, including learning topics, training methods, and barriers to education. Humanitarian HCPs were interviewed about perspectives on children's palliative care and preferences and needs for training. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and arranged into overarching themes. Thematic analysis was performed using qualitative description. Ten healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, psychologists, and health-project coordinators, were interviewed. Participants identified key patient and family-related barriers to palliative care in humanitarian settings, including misconceptions that palliative care was synonymous with end-of-life care or failure. Health system barriers included time constraints, insufficient provider knowledge, and a lack of standardized palliative care protocols. Important learning topics included learning strategies to address the stigma of serious illness and palliative care, culturally sensitive communication skills, and pain and symptom management. Preferred learning modalities included interactive lectures, role-play/simulation, and team-based case discussions. Participants preferred online training for theoretical knowledge and in-person learning to improve their ability to conduct serious illness conversations and learn other key palliative care skills. Palliative care prevents and relieves serious illness-related suffering for children with life-threatening and life-limiting conditions; however, most children in humanitarian settings are not able to access essential palliative care, leading to preventable pain and suffering. Limited palliative care knowledge and skills among HCPs in these settings are significant barriers to improving access to palliative care. Humanitarian HCPs are highly motivated to learn and improve their skills in children's palliative care, but they require adequate health system resources and training. These findings can guide educators in developing palliative care education packages for humanitarian HCPs.",

        "abstract": "Physical function in RA is largely influenced by multiple clinical factors, however, there is a growing body of evidence that psychological state and other comorbidities also play an essential role. Using data obtained in the COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases study, an international self-reported e-survey, we aimed to explore the predictive ability of sociodemographic and clinical variables on Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Physical Function Short Form 10a (PROMIS PF-10a) in RA and to investigate variation in disease activity and functional outcomes based on country-level socio-economic parameters. Patient demographics, disease characteristics including current symptom status, functional status and treatment variables, as well as income level of the country of residence, were extracted from survey responses. PROMIS PF-10a scores were compared across country income levels. The influence of extracted variables on reversed PROMIS PF-10a scores were investigated using negative binomial univariable- and multivariable regression. A total of 1342 RA patients were included in this analysis. In the optimised parsimonious predictive model for reversed PROMIS PF-10a, older age, female gender, disease duration, fatigue and pain levels were independently associated with worse physical function, whereas Asian ethnicity, higher overall physical health ratings, ability to carry out everyday activities and residing in a country with an upper-middle or high-income level were independently associated with better physical function. Our study highlights that clinical factors remain strong predictors of physical function in RA, irrespective of individual and country-level socio-economic differences. Interestingly, high country-level income was associated with better physical function, irrespective of individual sociodemographic and clinical factors.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic presented a 'double-edged sword' for older adults: not only were they more susceptible to the virus, but its broader consequences also exacerbated other challenges, particularly those related to psychosocial well-being. Limited evidence exists on how older adults perceive the pandemic and its impact on their well-being and the role of social workers in addressing these challenges, particularly in resource-limited settings like Nigeria. This study explored older adults' perceived risks regarding COVID-19, its impact on their psychosocial well-being, and the role of social workers in addressing these challenges in Nigeria. A phenomenological and exploratory research design was used. In-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with 16 older adults and 4 social workers in Onitsha metropolis, Anambra State, Southeast Nigeria. Data were analyzed through reflexive thematic analysis. The findings revealed that the COVID-19 restrictive measures negatively impacted the psychosocial well-being of older adults, where social isolation, lack of support, the inability to engage in wellbeing activities, and emotional trauma collectively contributed to a significant decline in their mental and emotional health. Additionally, widespread misconceptions about the origin of COVID-19 led to reluctance in adopting preventive measures. While social workers provided some awareness and counselling sessions, their involvement was limited. Social workers were not recognized as part of the frontline response team, and their efforts were primarily constrained by governmental and institutional neglect. The findings highlight the need for policy initiatives to enhance social workers involvement in strengthening the psychosocial resilience of older adults and addressing misconceptions during public health emergencies. Comprehensive strategies are essential for safeguarding the psychosocial well-being of older adults in future pandemics or similar crises.",

        "abstract": "Adherence to antihypertensive medication is crucial to control blood pressure (BP) and hypertension management outcomes. In Bangladesh, as in many other countries, poor adherence to medication represents a challenge to effective hypertension management. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and relationship between medication adherence and BP management among hypertensive patients in Bangladesh. The PREDIcT-HTN study in Northern Bangladesh aims to evaluate major adverse clinical events in treated hypertensive patients. The study involves 2643 hypertensive patients from a medical center, with data collected through baseline information and yearly follow-ups until 2025. The first follow-up visit was conducted between January and March 2021. Following the 2020 ISH-global hypertension guideline, patients were classified as having controlled BP, grade-I, or grade-II uncontrolled BP. Patients were divided into three groups (good, moderate, and poor) based on their 9-item Hill-Bone medication adherence scale. A multinomial regression analysis was conducted to identify the association between medication adherence and BP control after adjusting potential confounders. Analysis of 2276 hypertensive patients (mean age 51.31 ± 11.58 years) revealed that 36.1% had grade-I and 24.2% had grade-II uncontrolled hypertension. Most patients (78%) displayed moderate adherence, and 15% showed poor medication adherence. Certain patient subgroups had higher rates of poor adherence: females (17.1%) compared to males (12.2%), rural residents (22.4%) compared to city-dwellers (12.2%), and newly diagnosed patients (17.2%) compared to those diagnosed 2-5 years earlier (12.6%). Multivariable analysis found a strong association between medication adherence and BP control. Compared to poor adherence, moderate adherence (relative risk ratio (RRR):0.50, 95%CI:0.36-0.68) and good adherence (RRR:0.56, 95%CI:0.35-0.91) were associated with better control. Increasing age, rural living, and uncontrolled hypertension were also linked. Comorbidities worsened BP control, and managing multiple medications contributed to poor adherence and grade-II hypertension in patients. The high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension in Bangladesh underscores the need for improved treatment strategies. Addressing medication adherence is essential for better BP control, with particular attention needed for women, rural residents, and newly diagnosed individuals. A comprehensive approach is warranted, including strategies to enhance adherence, early diagnosis, personalized treatment, and simplified medication regimens. These efforts align with the UN's 2030 SDGs, emphasizing targeted interventions for equitable healthcare access and outcomes.",

The research further seeks to evaluate the antibiotic resistance patterns of the identified bacterial isolates. 84 paper currency notes and 56 coins were collected from seven different sources. Bacterial contamination was assessed using standard bacteriological and biochemical tests to identify and characterize the bacteria. Antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated strains was evaluated using an antibiogram study. A total of 368 bacterial isolates were detected across the sampled currency, with 99% of the currency samples contaminated by bacteria. Paper currency exhibited a higher prevalence of contamination compared to coins. Gram-staining revealed 20% Gram-positive and 80% Gram-negative bacteria on notes, compared to 38% Gram-positive and 62% Gram-negative bacteria on coins. Bacterial contamination was most frequent in samples from fish sellers, followed by poultry sellers, fruit sellers, and restaurants. The most commonly identified bacteria were <i>Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Klebsiella aerogenes</i>. Antibiotic resistance testing revealed that all isolates were 100% resistant to amoxicillin, ampicillin, and penicillin G, while showing 100% sensitivity to azithromycin and gentamycin. Notably, 70.8% of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline, and 75% showed resistance to cefotaxime. The widespread contamination of currency in Bangladesh with multidrug-resistant bacteria underscore the growing concern about antibiotic resistance.

        "title": "Improving diagnostics and surveillance of malaria among displaced people in Africa.",
        "abstract": "African communities that have been forced to leave their homes experience a considerably greater susceptibility to malaria as a result of densely populated living conditions, restricted availability of healthcare, and environmental influences. Internally displaced individuals frequently live in large settlements with restricted availability to drinking water, essential sanitation, and medical services, intensifying the spread of malaria. As a result, the occurrence of malaria is significantly more common among refugees and internally displaced individuals compared to those who are not displaced. This leads to greater rates of illness and death, especially among young people. Insufficient monitoring worsens the condition, leading to delayed identification and medical intervention, and contributing to a higher incidence of severe malaria and deaths. Furthermore, these communities are faced with economic consequences that contribute to the continuation of poverty and the worsening of socio-economic inequalities. Furthermore, the psychological impact of malaria, which is marked by feelings of anxiety and uncertainty, is particularly severe in vulnerable populations such as displaced children and pregnant women, aggravating the overall burden. Hence, addressing malaria in displaced populations in Africa requires comprehensive and well-coordinated strategies. Advanced diagnostic and surveillance technologies are essential for promptly identifying and treating malaria, providing chances to monitor and control its spread effectively. Collaboration among healthcare, policy, and humanitarian sectors is crucial for implementing comprehensive solutions that incorporate enhanced diagnostics, surveillance, and socio-psychological support. Active involvement of the community, usage of Community Health Workers, and regular collection of surveillance data are crucial in increasing awareness, directing control efforts, and tackling the specific difficulties encountered by displaced groups. Moreover, the implementation of environmental management, the incorporation of health services, and the utilization of adaptable healthcare interventions are essential for reducing the effects of malaria. To mitigate the impact of malaria and improve health outcomes among displaced populations in Africa, it is crucial to focus on these specific areas.",

        "abstract": "Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is an essential constituent of the stigmoid body (STB) and is known as a neuroprotective interactor with causal agents for several neurodegenerative disorders, including huntingtin (HTT) in Huntington's disease. Previous in vitro studies showed that compared to normal HTT, STB/HAP1 exhibited a higher binding affinity for mutant HTT. The detailed in vivo relationships of STB/HAP1 with endogenous HTT, however, have not been clarified yet. This study examined the distribution of endogenous HTT and its relationships with STB/HAP1 in the adult mouse brain and spinal cord using light/fluorescence microscopy. Our results show that HTT immunoreactivity is highly distributed in the striatum, medial septal nucleus (MS), nucleus of the horizontal limb/ vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB, VDB), substantia innominata basal part (SIB), pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), autonomic preganglionic neurons, and brainstem/spinal motoneurons. More than 90 % of HTT-immunoreactive (ir) neurons contain STB/HAP1 immunoreactivity in MS, VBD/HDB, SIB, PPTg, LDTg, and autonomic preganglionic nuclei. HTT-ir neurons in the striatal and motor nuclei, however, do not exhibit HAP1 immunoreactivity. These suggest that due to the absence of STB/HAP1-protectivity, HTT-ir striatal/motor neurons are more vulnerable to neurodegeneration than other HAP1-expressing HTT neurons. Our current findings might provide a framework for elucidating the pathophysiological functions of endogenous HTT and HAP1 in the central nervous system.",

        "abstract": "Palliative care (PC) is an interdisciplinary approach aimed at improving the physical, psychological, and spiritual well-being of patients and families affected by life-threatening diseases. This study aimed to investigate the need for PC among critically ill patients and their quality of life (QOL) in low-income groups in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study was conducted at four healthcare facilities from March to April 2023, involving 553 registered patients with advanced chronic conditions. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 183 patients in the advanced stage of illness were included. We collected data on sociodemographic, comorbidities, disabilities, and the 10-item African Palliative Outcome Scale (APOS). The Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool (SPICT) was used to identify individuals requiring PC. The study investigated patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 3-4, indicating significant functional impairment, and explored QOL across four domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environmental factors. The mean age of the 183 patients was 53.8 (± 14.53) years, with 69.5% being female. We found that 10.3% of patients with chronic illness required PC, particularly cancer patients (87%) and those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (53.3%). The APOS scores indicated that family anxiety (48.6%) was the most burdensome issue, followed by severe pain (15.5%), severe worry about illness (22.4%), and feelings of life being unworthy (9.4%). Patients with severe functional limitations (ECOG 3-4) were significantly more likely to need PC (58%) compared to those with moderate or no limitations (ECOG 0-2) (24%). Among those requiring PC, 70.1% rated their QOL as poor or very-poor, while only 23.8% of patients not needing PC reported similar ratings. Female patients had poorer QOL than males across all domains, and those facing financial hardships also experienced significantly lower QOL. In Bangladesh's low-income communities, a significant proportion of patients with chronic illnesses require palliative care (PC) due to advanced conditions. The findings emphasize the importance of integrating PC early in the treatment process for cancer and CKD patients, as it can greatly improve their QOL and provide essential support for both patients and families. The results advocate for a holistic approach to PC that addresses physical, psychological, social, and environmental factors affecting patients' QOL.",
