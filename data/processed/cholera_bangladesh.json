        "title": "<i>Vibrio cholerae</i> lineage and pangenome diversity vary geographically across Bangladesh over 1 year.",
        "abstract": "Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal disease caused by <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. It remains a major public health challenge worldwide, and particularly in the endemic region around the Bay of Bengal. Over decadal time scales, one lineage typically dominates and spreads in global pandemic waves. However, it remains unclear to what extent diverse lineages co-circulate during a single outbreak. Defining the pool of diversity over finer time-scales is important because the selective pressures that impact <i>V. cholerae</i>, namely antibiotics and phages, are dynamic on these scales. To study the nationwide diversity of <i>V. cholerae</i>, we long-read sequenced 273 <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i> genomes from seven hospitals over 1 year (2018) in Bangladesh. Four major <i>V. cholerae</i> lineages were identified: three known lineages, BD-1, BD-2a and BD-2b, and a novel lineage that we call BD-3. In 2022, BD-1 caused a large cholera outbreak in Dhaka, at which point it had replaced BD-2 as the most common lineage in Bangladesh. We show that, in 2018, BD-1 was already predominant in the five northern regions, including Dhaka, consistent with an origin from northern India. By contrast, we observed a higher diversity of lineages in the two southern regions near the coast. The four lineages differed in pangenome content, including integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) and genes involved in resistance to bacteriophages and antibiotics. Notably, BD-2a lacked an ICE and is predicted to be more sensitive to phages and antibiotics, yet persisted throughout the sampling period. Genes previously associated with antibiotic resistance in <i>V. cholerae</i> isolated from Bangladesh in the prior decade were entirely absent from all lineages in 2018-2019, suggesting shifting costs and benefits of encoding these genes. Our results highlight the diverse nature of the <i>V. cholerae</i> pangenome and geographic structure within a single outbreak season. This diversity provides the raw material for adaptation to antibiotics, phages and other selective pressures.",

        "abstract": "Enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC) is a major cause of diarrheal illness, and population-based data on the incidence of clinically significant ETEC diarrhea in developing countries are limited. We provide insight into ETEC epidemiology; we followed a population-based cohort in a vaccine trial. We analyzed data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial of an oral cholera vaccine conducted in an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study covers 90 geographical clusters with an average population of 2988 households/cluster (baseline population 268 896). Two cohort analyses were conducted, 1 as dynamic cohort that included all subjects at vaccination, in-migrants, and births over 4 years and a closed cohort, which included only individuals present at baseline. We evaluated individuals placed under treatment center-based diarrheal surveillance between 2011 and 2015. In the dynamic cohort, the ETEC incidence was 150/100 000 person-years (PY; 95% CI, 141-159), with seasonal peaks during warmer months, and in the closed cohort, the incidence was 153/100 000 PY (95% CI, 140, 166). The highest rate was seen in children aged <1 year (2007; 95% CI, 1664-2402), then in those aged 1-4 years (314; 95% CI, 252-386), and again the rate rose in those aged >45 years (219/100 000 PY; 95% CI, 177-267). The rate of severe ETEC was ≤35/100 000 PY for persons aged ≤45 years (95% CI, 27-44), but rose to 82 for adults aged >45 years (95% CI, 58-113). ETEC diarrhea is a major health problem in young children and older adults, prevention through vaccination and improved water, sanitation, and hygiene should target both age groups.",

        "abstract": "Slide agglutination for serogroup and/or serotype identification is a crucial step for confirming cholera by culture. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are typically used directly on stool but are not considered sufficient for cholera confirmation. However, they may provide a practical alternative to the slide agglutination step of culture<i>,</i> as they are easy to use, store, and require minimal training. This study evaluates the concordance of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> O1/O139 detection from presumptive colonies by slide agglutination with RDTs. Patients (≥1 year) with acute watery diarrhea at the icddr,b Dhaka hospital were enrolled. Stool samples were cultured on thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose medium, and presumptive colonies were subcultured on Gelatin Agar medium. Isolates were then tested by slide agglutination and four commercial cholera RDTs. From 4 February 2024 through 24 May 2025, 1,638 patients with acute watery diarrhea were enrolled, 1,140 (70%) had presumptive <i>V. cholerae</i> colonies, and 482 (29%) were culture-confirmed as <i>V. cholerae</i> O1. We tested suspected <i>V. cholerae</i> colonies using Cholkit (n=1,140), SD Bioline (n=693), Crystal VC O1/O139 (n=693), and Crystal VC O1 (n=655) RDT kits. RDTs showed near-perfect concordance with slide agglutination. Using slide agglutination as the reference, the sensitivity of the RDT kits ranged from 99.3% to 99.6% and the specificity from 99.3% to 99.7%. RDTs offer a practical and potentially easier alternative to slide agglutination of presumptive <i>V. cholerae</i> colonies within typical cholera culture protocols. This may help to provide a pathway to quick confirmation of outbreaks in settings where lab facilities and reagents may be limited.IMPORTANCEThis study demonstrated that rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can effectively replace traditional slide agglutination methods to confirm suspected <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> colonies belonging to the O1 serogroup, which are responsible for the current seventh cholera pandemic. Comparing four RDTs to slide agglutination, we found almost perfect agreement, with sensitivity and specificity exceeding 99%. Since RDTs are cheaper, easier to use and store, and require less technical training, adopting them could significantly speed up cholera outbreak confirmation, especially in areas with limited laboratory resources. This practical shift could lead to faster responses to cholera outbreaks, ultimately improving public health surveillance and disease control globally.",

The objective of this scoping review was to describe the current evidence regarding the surveillance of <i>V. cholerae</i> in wastewater and wastewater-impacted environmental waters (including drinking water). We conducted a comprehensive electronic search, updated to January 2025. Following duplicate screening, we identified 114 eligible studies. The studies evaluated early WES warning systems, monitored trends in ongoing outbreaks, and described serogroups and virulent strains of toxigenic <i>V. cholerae</i> circulating in communities. Most studies were conducted in South-East Asia (44%), particularly India and Bangladesh, where cholera is endemic. A large proportion of studies detected <i>V. cholerae</i> subgroup O1 or O139, and numerous virulent strains such as <i>ctxA/B</i>. Studies were generally poorly reported, for example, inconsistent reporting on sample management, data reliability, and sampling frequency were common. WES has not been widely integrated into existing surveillance systems for real-time cholera monitoring. Our findings underscore the need for further clearly reported research to clarify the role of WES for early warning systems for cholera outbreaks, and to identify strategies that may optimise WES implementation for public health benefit.",

New evidence has emerged and the ways in which the vaccines are used have changed. We aimed to provide an updated synthesis of evidence on protection conferred by kOCV. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we used the same search procedure as a previous systematic review to identify randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies that reported estimates of protection conferred by kOCVs against medically attended, confirmed cholera. Eligible studies in English, French, Spanish, or Chinese published up until March 8, 2024, including those identified in the previous review, were included. Data on efficacy and effectiveness were extracted, as were the number of doses, duration of follow-up, and age group. Efficacy and effectiveness estimates were summarised separately using random-effect models to estimate protection by time since vaccination; meta-regression models were used to estimate protection, by dose, as a function of time since vaccination. This updated study is registered along with the original review with PROSPERO (CRD42016048232). We identified 8205 records published online up until March 8, 2024, including 6224 articles from the previous review and 1981 articles from our new search (after Jan 1, 2016). Of these, 53 were eligible for full-text review. Five RCTs and ten observational studies from 23 publications were included. Average two-dose efficacy 12 months after vaccination was 55% (95% CI 46-62), declining to 44% (25-59) 48 months after vaccination. Average two-dose effectiveness was 69% (58-78) 12 months after vaccination, declining to 47% (9-70) 48 months after vaccination. Only one RCT assessed one-dose efficacy and found sustained protection for 24 months (57% [42-69]) among those 5 years and older with no significant protection in younger children. Average one-dose effectiveness 12 months after vaccination was 60% (51-68) and after 24 months was 47% (34-58). Using age group-specific meta-analysis, we found that average two-dose efficacy in children younger than 5 years was half that of older individuals. Two doses of kOCV provide protection against medically attended cholera for at least 4 years after vaccination. One dose of kOCV provides protection for at least 2 years after vaccination, but wanes faster than that of two doses. Children younger than 5 years are less protected by kOCVs than those aged 5 years and older, regardless of the number of doses received. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

        "abstract": "Effective cholera outbreak response requires accurate bedside rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) because access to laboratories is often limited. Formative studies suggest cholera diagnostics have multiple vulnerabilities, including antibiotics and predation by bacteriophage ('phage') specific to <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> (<i>Vc</i>). We conducted a prospective nationwide study in Bangladesh among over 2000 patients with diarrhoeal disease to characterize how these vulnerabilities impact RDT performance. Assays included culture, qPCR and mass spectrometry. With the current gold standard of culture or qPCR <i>Vc</i> positivity, we found no effect of phage on RDT performance. When the diagnostic criteria were expanded to include phage, there was a small decrease in RDT sensitivity. In contrast, large increases in sensitivity and specificity were observed among patients with moderate and severe dehydration. Using the expanded definition, the odds of RDT positivity decreased among cholera patients with phage exposure. The effect was most robust among patients with severe dehydration. Antibiotic were detected in over 80% of samples by LC-MS/MS which limited testing for effects on RDTs. Applying these findings, we estimated that restricting RDT use to severe patients with no reported antibiotic exposure increases sensitivity by 50% compared to unrestricted use. If phage were a diagnostic proxy for <i>Vc</i>, we estimate RDT would miss an additional 17% of cholera cases. Cholera RDTs have critical limitations that require consideration in global deployments. Inclusion of phage detection in diagnostic criteria may improve case detection which requires further study. The impact of these findings likely extends to other diseases where diagnostics share similar vulnerabilities.",

However, attributing etiology remains challenging in high-burden settings where coinfections are common. The Antibiotics for Children with severe Diarrhea (ABCD) trial provides a unique opportunity to leverage azithromycin treatment response to identify bacterial diarrhea. We analyzed data from 6,692 children with watery diarrhea enrolled in ABCD (2017 to 2019) who were randomized to receive azithromycin or placebo. We modelled the heterogeneity in the azithromycin treatment response by the enteric pathogen quantity detected by quantitative PCR using log-binomial regression. Azithromycin treatment response varied by pathogen quantity, with the strongest effect observed for <i>Shigella</i>. Each log₁₀ increase in <i>Shigella</i> quantity was associated with a 13% reduction (95% CI: 3-23%) in diarrhea risk at day 3 in the azithromycin group compared to placebo. We observed similar, though non-significant, trends for <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, ST-ETEC, and tEPEC. In contrast, no association was found between pathogen quantity and azithromycin response for <i>Campylobacter</i>, LT-ETEC, or EAEC. These patterns remained consistent when evaluating hospitalization or death risk within 90 days. The observed associations between azithromycin treatment response and pathogen quantity for <i>Shigella</i>, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, ST-ETEC, and tEPEC support prior evidence that these pathogens are likely causes of diarrhea when present in high quantities. Conversely, the absence of a similar response pattern for <i>Campylobacter</i>, LT-ETEC, and EAEC is consistent with large-scale studies showing a limited association between their quantities and diarrhea.",

Yet, information about the severity of cholera risk is limited as risk varies over time and changing weather patterns make historical cholera risk predictions less reliable. In this paper, we examine how households use geographically and temporally personalized cholera risk predictions to inform their beliefs and behaviors related to cholera and its aversion. We estimate how access to a smartphone application containing monthly cholera risk predictions unique to a user's home location affects households' beliefs about their cholera risk and their water use and hygiene behaviors. We find that households with access to this application feel more equipped to respond to environmental and health risks and reduce their reliance on surface water for bathing and washing-a common cholera transmission pathway. We do not find that households invest additional resources into drinking water treatment, nor do we find reductions in self-reported cholera incidence. Further, households with a static, non-personalized app containing public health information about cholera exhibit similar patterns of beliefs updating. Taken together, our results suggest that access to dynamic risk information can help households make safer water choices, yet improving design and credibility remain important dimensions for increasing application usability.",

Plant-derived biopolymers such as cellulose, starch, pullulans; microbes-derived chitosan, poly-L-lysine; animal-derived collagen, gelatin, spongin, etc. are proven to possess antimicrobial properties. They exert their antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens namely Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, etc. As antimicrobial resistance becomes a global phenomenon and threatens the effective prevention and treatment of infections caused by pathogens, biopolymers could be a promising candidate/substitute for conventional antimicrobials available in markets. Biopolymers can have detrimental effects on microbial cells such as disruption of the cell walls and cell membranes; damage to the DNA caused by strand breakage, unwinding, or cross-linking resulting in impeded DNA transcription and replication; lowering the amount of energy required for metabolic processes by compromising the proton motive force. Biopolymers also interfere with the quorum sensing mechanism and biofilm formation of microbes and modulate the host immune system by downregulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways resulting in the decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, conjugating these biopolymers with other antimicrobial agents could be a promising approach to control multidrug-resistant foodborne pathogens. This review provides an overview of the various sources of biopolymers with special reference to their antimicrobial applications, especially against foodborne pathogens, and highlights their antimicrobial mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Northern Cameroon in Central Africa has experienced recurring cholera outbreaks despite ongoing efforts to control the disease. While most cholera studies focus on O1 pandemic Vibrio cholerae strains, non-O1/O139 strains are increasingly recognized for their infection potential and dynamic relationships with O1 strains during outbreaks. Here we explore the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships of non-O1/O139 V. cholerae (NOVC) isolated from environmental water sources in Northern Cameroon. These NOVC strains show significant genetic diversity and virulence potential. They are closely related to environmental strains from Kenya and clinical strains from Argentina and Haiti, suggesting transmissions across countries and continents, likely facilitated by human carriers. The highly conserved tcpA gene found in some strains from Cameroon is closely related to the tcpA O1 Classical type, suggesting direct or indirect genetic interactions between these environmental NOVC strains and pandemic strains. Our findings underscore the importance of environmental surveillance and further studies of NOVC strains to better understand cholera outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "The Ganges delta of the Bay of Bengal is a recognized hotspot for the emergence and spread of novel variants of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Despite being a diverse species, very little information is available concerning environmental and human-associated aspects of <i>V. cholerae</i> serogroups, other than the two major epidemic-related serogroups O1 and O139. This represents a crucial gap in understanding the spectrum of diversity, ecology, and epidemiology of the species influencing the dynamics of global cholera. In this study, we describe an emerging variant of <i>V. cholerae</i> displaying the antigenic property of serogroup O47, associated with a cholera-like outbreak in coastal Bangladesh where cholera has been endemic for centuries. This outbreak coincides with a rise in cases of cholera caused by <i>V. cholerae</i> O1, as well as frequency of isolation of serogroups O47 and O1 from the environment. The <i>V. cholerae</i> O47 isolates proved clonal in nature, and their genome biology revealed distinct features, with respect to multidrug resistance (MDR), serogroup-specific genes, genomic island combinations, and overall phylogenetic properties. Genome comparison confirmed the absence of canonical virulence factors of <i>V. cholerae</i> O1 and O139, namely, cholera toxin (CTX) and toxin-co-regulated pili (TCP), and the presence of putative virulence factors including type 3 secretion system (T3SS) and an MDR pseudo-compound transposon, carrying genes for macrolide resistance and extended spectrum beta-lactamase. Results of the study suggest that <i>V. cholerae</i> O47 could represent an emerging <i>Vibrio</i> pathogen with the potential to spread virulence and antimicrobial resistance traits impacting the management of cholera-like diseases.IMPORTANCEDespite the global insurgence of human diseases caused by Vibrios in recent years, most research focuses only on the O1 serogroup of <i>V. cholerae</i>, leaving a significant gap concerning the environmental and human-associated aspects of other serogroups found in nature. Although other serogroups are often found associated with sporadic diarrhea cases, in 1992-1993, a massive cholera-like diarrhea epidemic was initiated by a \"non-O1\" serogroup, namely, O139 that temporally displaced O1 from endemic cholera in the Bay of Bengal villages of Bangladesh and India, highlighting the potential threat they might pose. This study describes yet another emerging variant of <i>V. cholerae</i>, displaying the antigenic property of serogroup O47, associated with a cholera-like outbreak in a coastal locality in Bangladesh. Findings of the study offer critical insights into the genome biology of <i>V. cholerae</i> O47 and its potential implications for understanding their ecology and epidemiology of cholera-like diseases.",

        "abstract": "Mass oral cholera vaccination campaigns targeted at subnational areas with high incidence are central to global cholera elimination efforts. Serological surveillance offers a complementary approach to address gaps in clinical surveillance in these regions. However, similar immune responses from vaccination and infection can lead to overestimates of incidence of infection. To address this, we analyzed antibody dynamics in infected and vaccinated individuals to refine seroincidence estimation strategies for partially vaccinated populations. We tested 757 longitudinal serum samples from confirmed <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> O1 cases and uninfected contacts in Bangladesh as well as vaccinees from Bangladesh and Haiti, using a multiplex bead assay to measure IgG, IgM, and IgA binding to five cholera-specific antigens. Infection elicited stronger and broader antibody responses than vaccination, with rises in cholera toxin B-subunit (CTB) and toxin-coregulated pilus A (TcpA) antibodies uniquely associated with infection. Previously proposed random forest models frequently misclassified vaccinated individuals as recently infected (over 20% at some time points) during the first four months post-vaccination. To address this, we developed new random forest models incorporating vaccinee data, which kept false positive rates among vaccinated (1%) and unvaccinated (4%) individuals low without a significant loss in sensitivity. Simulated serosurveys demonstrated that unbiased seroincidence estimates could be achieved within 21 days of vaccination campaigns by ascertaining vaccination status of participants or applying updated models. These approaches to overcome biases in serological surveillance enable reliable seroincidence estimation even in areas with recent vaccination campaigns enhancing the utility of serological surveillance as an epidemiologic tool in moderate-to-high cholera incidence settings.",

The World Health Organization recommends G6PD testing prior to 8AQ-based hypnozoitocidal treatment. We undertook an individual level meta-analysis of the performance of commercially available quantitative point-of-care diagnostics (PoCs) compared with reference spectrophotometry. A systematic literature search (PROSPERO: CRD42022330733) identified 595 articles of which 16 (2.7%) fulfilled pre-defined inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis, plus an additional 4 datasets. In total there were 12,678 paired measurements analyzed, 10,446 (82.4%) by STANDARD G6PD Test (SD Biosensor, RoK, [SDB]), 2,042 (16.1%) by CareStart G6PD Biosensor (AccessBio, USA, [CSA]), 150 (1.2%) by CareStart Biosensor (WellsBio, RoK [CSW]), and 40 (0.3%) by FINDER (Baebies, USA, [FBA]). The pooled sensitivities of the SDB when measuring G6PD activity <30% of normal were 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72-0.89) for capillary and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.75-0.99) for venous blood samples. The corresponding values for measuring <70% G6PD activity were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.67-0.99) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.73-0.96), respectively. The pooled specificity of the SDB was high (>96%) for all blood samples and G6PD activity thresholds. Irrespective of the blood samples and thresholds applied, sensitivity of the CSA did not exceed 62%, although specificity remained high at both 30% and 70% thresholds (>88%). Only one study each for CSW and FBA was included. Sensitivities of the CSW were 0.04 (95% CI: 0.01-0.14) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71-0.89) at the 30% and 70% thresholds, respectively (venous blood samples).

        "abstract": "Understanding the effects of climate change on health outcomes is crucial for effective policy formulation and intervention strategies. However, in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, like Bangladesh, the true extent of these effects remains unexplored due to data scarcity. This study aims to assess available evidence on climate change-related health outcomes in Bangladesh, to compare it with actual national occurrences, and to explore challenges related to climate change and health data. We first conducted a systematic review to summarize the climate-sensitive diseases examined in existing literature in Bangladesh. The review results were then compared with over 2.8 million samples from the government's data repository, representing reported cases of climate-sensitive diseases during 2017-2022. This comparison aimed to identify discrepancies between the diseases currently occurring in Bangladesh related to climate change and available knowledge through existing research. Additionally, we also explored the limitations of the data recorded in the government data repository. The available literature in Bangladesh reports only a few specific climate-sensitive diseases, including Diarrhea, Dengue, Cholera, Malaria, Pneumonia, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypertension, Urinary-Tract Infections, and Malnutrition, which were also considered in few studies. This represents a segment of the total 510 reported climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh, of which 143 diseases were responsible for 90.66% of the total occurrences. The most common forms of diseases were diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious (28.51%), pneumonia (18.88%), anxiety disorders, panic disorders, generalized anxiety disorders (13.2%), and others (13.15%). Additionally, Urinary-Tract infections (7.87%), cholera (3.03%), and typhoid fever (3.27%) were other frequently reported climate-sensitive diseases. We also explored several challenges related to available data in the government repository, which include inadequate collection of patients' comprehensive socio-demographic information and the absence of a unique patient identifier. The findings underscore the urgent need to tackle data challenges in understanding climate-sensitive diseases in Bangladesh. Policies and programs are required to prioritize the digitalization of the healthcare system and implement a unique patient identification number to facilitate accurate tracking and analysis of health data. Climate Change, including rising temperature and extreme weather events like cyclone and floods, poses a significant global health threat [1]. The World Health Organization estimates climate change already causes at least 150,000 deaths annually at the global level, and that number is projected to double by 2030. Beside these other impact of climate change are far-reaching, leading to forced displacement, malnutrition and increased incidence of diseases such as dengue, diarrhea, and pneumonia [2]. Additionally, climate change has established links to mental health issues, like anxiety and depression [3]. The effects are particularly severe in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) due to limited resources and inadequate infrastructure for coping with erratic weather and disasters [4]. We undertook a comprehensive mixed-method study, incorporating a systematic review of existing studies conducted in Bangladesh, along with an analysis of government data repository.

        "abstract": "The Cholera-Hospital-based-Intervention-for-7-Days (CHoBI7) mobile health (mHealth) program is a targeted water treatment and hygiene (WASH) program for the household members of diarrhea patients, initiated in the healthcare facility with a single in-person visit and reinforced through weekly voice and text messages for 3 months. A recent randomized controlled trial of the CHoBI7 mHealth program in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh, found that this intervention significantly increased WASH behaviors and reduced diarrhea prevalence. The objective of this present study was to conduct formative research using an implementation science framework to adapt the CHoBI7 mHealth program for scalable implementation in rural Bangladesh, and to promote construction of self-made handwashing stations (CHoBI7 Scale-up program). We conducted a 3-month multi-phase pilot with 275 recipients and 25 semi-structured interviews, 10 intervention planning workshops, and 2 focus group discussions with intervention recipients and program implementers. High appropriateness, acceptability, and adoption of the CHoBI7 Scale-up program was observed, with most recipients constructing self-made handwashing stations (90%) and chlorinating drinking water (63%) and 50% of participants observed handwashing with soap in the final pilot phase. At the recipient level, facilitators included weekly voice and text messages with videos on handwashing station construction, which served as reminders for the promoted water treatment and hand hygiene behaviors. Barriers included perceptions that self-made iron filters commonly used in households also removed microbial contamination from water and therefore chlorine treatment was not needed, and mobile messages not always being shared among household members. At the implementer level, facilitators for program implementation included follow-up phone calls to household members not present at the healthcare facility at the time of intervention delivery, and the promotion of multiple self-made handwashing station designs. Barriers included high patient volume in healthcare facilities, as well as the high iron in groundwater in the area that reduced chlorination effectiveness. These findings provide valuable evidence for adapting the CHoBI7 mHealth program for a rural setting, with a lower-cost, scalable design, and demonstrated the important role of formative research for tailoring WASH programs to new contexts.",

For the diarrheal pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, a higher burden of its lytic phage, ICP1, in patient stool correlates with reduced disease severity<sup>4</sup>. However, direct molecular evidence of phage-driven selection of epidemic <i>V. cholerae</i> has not been demonstrated. Here, through clinical surveillance in cholera-endemic Bangladesh, we capture the acquisition of a parasitic anti-phage MGE, PLE11, that initiated a selective sweep coinciding with the largest cholera outbreak in recent records. PLE11 exhibited potent anti-phage activity against co-circulating ICP1, explaining its rapid and dominating emergence. We identify PLE11-encoded Rta as the novel defense responsible and provide evidence that Rta restricts phage tail assembly. Using experimental evolution, we predict phage counteradaptations against PLE11 and document the eventual emergence and selection of ICP1 that achieves a convergent evolutionary outcome. By probing how PLEs hijack phage structural proteins to drive their horizontal transmission while simultaneously restricting phage tail assembly, we discover that PLEs manipulate tail assembly to construct chimeric tails comprised of MGE and phage-encoded proteins. Collectively, our findings reveal the molecular basis of the natural selection of a globally significant pathogen and its virus in a clinically relevant context.",

We investigated antimicrobial resistance, risk factors (socioeconomic, behavioral, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), and clinical characteristics of <i>Shigella</i> diarrhea in Mukuru informal settlement and surrounding villages in Nairobi, Kenya.

However, information on Euvichol-Plus's effectiveness is limited. Using this vaccine in a cholera epidemic in Dhaka, Bangladesh, provided the opportunity to evaluate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) using a test-negative design. A two-dose regimen of Euvichol-Plus was administered to individuals aged >1 year in a population of ca. 900 000 in two campaign rounds between June and August 2022, with prospective registration of all persons who received at least one dose. We conducted systematic surveillance in two key facilities, enrolling patients with acute watery diarrhoea who were eligible for vaccination from the campaign's start and who presented for care between 21 August 2022 and 20 August 2023. Faecal culture-positive cholera cases were matched to up to four faecal culture-negative controls by age, presentation date and facility. Vaccination status was documented without knowledge of culture results. Conditional logistic regression models estimated the OR for the vaccination-cholera association, and the VE of the two-dose regimen was calculated as [(1-OR) × 100]. The analysis included 226 cases and 552 matched controls. The adjusted VE of two doses of the Euvichol-Plus vaccine against medically attended cholera was 66% (99.5% CI: 30 to 83) for all recipients.

A key focus is the potential role of probiotics as a novel intervention approach for cholera prevention and management. Probiotics are promising as an adjunctive approach to existing therapies as they can enhance gut barrier function, induce competitive exclusion of pathogens, and modulate host immune responses.

        "abstract": "Waterborne bacteria pose a serious hazard to human health, hence a precise detection method is required to identify them. A photonic crystal fiber sensor that takes into account the dangers of aquatic bacteria has been suggested, and its optical characteristics in the THz range have been quantitatively assessed. The PCF sensor was designed and examined as computed in Comsol Multiphysics, a program in which uses the method of \"Finite Element Method\" (FEM). At 3.2 THz operating frequency, the proposed sensor performs better than the others in all tested cases, with a high sensitivity of 96.78% for Vibrio cholera, 97.54% for E. coli, and 97.40% for Bacillus anthracis. It also has a very low CL of 2.095 × 10-13 dB/cm for Vibrio cholera, 4.411 × 10-11 dB/cm for E. coli, and 1.355 × 10-11 dB/cm for Bacillus anthracis. The existing architecture has the potential to produce the sensor efficiently and scalable, opening the door for commercial applications. The innovation is in the optimization of structural parameters to increase the fiber's sensitivity to bacterial presence, thereby improving the interaction between terahertz waves and bacterial cells. It targets bacterial macromolecule absorption peaks to increase sensitivity. Localized field augmentation, which concentrates THz vibrations where bacteria interact more, may arise from optimization. By improving scattering, structural alterations can help identify bacteria by their characteristic scattering patterns. These improvements improve the sensor's trace bacteria detection. These factors increase the sensor's aquatic germ detection when combined. In aqueous environments, this results in a more precise and efficient detection, which could facilitate the real-time monitoring of bacterial contamination.

        "abstract": "Bangladesh is facing a formidable challenge in mitigating waterborne diseases risk exacerbated by climate change. However, a comprehensive understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of these diseases at the district level remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the spatio-temporal pattern and identifying the best tree-based ML models for determining the meteorological factors associated with waterborne diseases in Bangladesh. This study used district-level reported cases of waterborne diseases (cholera, amoebiasis, typhoid and hepatitis A) obtained from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation) sourced from NASA for the period spanning 2017 to 2020. Exploratory spatial analysis, spatial regression and tree-based machine learning models were utilized to analyze the data. From 2017 and 2020, Bangladesh reported 73, 606 cholera, 38, 472 typhoid, 2, 510 hepatitis A and 1, 643 amoebiasis disease cases. Among the waterborne diseases cholera showed higher incidence rates in Chapai-Nawabganj (456.23), Brahmanbaria (417.44), Faridpur (225.07), Nilphamari (188.62) and Pirojpur (171.62) districts. The spatial regression model identified mean temperature (β = 12.16, s.e: 3.91) as the significant risk factor of waterborne diseases. The optimal XGBoost model highlighted mean and minimum temperature, relative humidity and precipitation as determinants associated with waterborne diseases in Bangladesh from 2017 to 2020. The findings from the study, incorporating the One Health perspective, provide insights for planning early warning, prevention, and control strategies to combat waterborne diseases in Bangladesh and similar endemic countries. Precautionary measures and intensified surveillance need to be implemented in certain high-risk districts for waterborne diseases across the country.",

        "abstract": "Poor water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are the primary risks of exposure to enteric viral infection. Our study aimed to describe the role of WASH conditions and practices as risk factors for enteric viral infections in children under 5. Literature on the risk factors associated with all-cause diarrhea masks the taxa-specific drivers of diarrhea from specific pathogens, limiting the application of relevant control strategies. We analyzed data from children enrolled in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) across seven study sites between December 2007 and March 2011 as cases (moderate-to-severe diarrhea: MSD) and asymptomatic controls. MSD was defined as new and acute diarrhea, with at least one of the following criteria for MSD: dehydration based on the study clinician's assessment, dysentery, or hospitalization with diarrhea or dysentery. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the role of water quality, sanitation access, and hygiene facilities on the enteric viral pathogens adjusted for potential covariates. Among MSD symptomatic children (cases), longer water retrieval time (≥15 vs <15 min) was associated with increased Norovirus (aOR 1.33, 95 % CI 1.08-1.64) and Astrovirus (aOR 1.43, 95 % CI 1.01-2.02); scooping as drinking water retrieval method was associated with lower Rotavirus (aOR 0.77, 95 % CI 0.62-0.96), but higher Adenovirus (aOR 2.3, 95 % CI 1.32-4.11) infection compared to non-users. Among asymptomatic children (controls), consumption of non-tube well drinking water was associated with higher Norovirus infection (aOR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.01-1.89). Longer drinking water retrieval time (≥15 vs <15 min) increased Norovirus (aOR 1.47, 95 % CI 1.21-1.78) and Rotavirus (aOR 1.51, 95 % CI 1.20-1.89) infections. Pouring (aOR 0.51, 95 % CI 0.32-0.83) or scooping drinking water with a cup (aOR: 0.52; 95 % CI: 0.32, 0.86) lower Astrovirus infection; restricted water access (aOR 1.57, 95 % CI 1.21-2.02) higher Rotavirus infection. Handwashing before cooking was associated with lower Astrovirus (aOR 0.64, 95 % CI 0.47-0.88) infection in asymptomatic children. Our analysis did not find a significant effect of poor sanitation on different enteric viral pathogens examined. Norovirus and Astrovirus were detected more commonly in sub-Saharan Africa while Rotavirus was less prevalent than South Asia. Though we found statistically significant associations, we did not observe any overall pattern between WASH and enteric viral pathogens. Our findings provide insights to guide further research on targeted interventions for enteric viral pathogens, responsible for a major burden of pediatric diarrhea globally.",

        "abstract": "Patients with cholera have been shown to be protected against subsequent cholera for 3 years after their initial episode. We aimed to assess protection at 10 years of follow-up. In this retrospective cohort study, cohorts of patients treated for cholera (index patients) and contemporaneously selected age-matched individuals without cholera (controls), randomly selected from the population of Matlab, Bangladesh, were assembled between 1990 and 2009 and followed for up to 10 years. Selection of participants who had no history of cholera in the 5 years before selection proceeded in secular sequence, and selection was done without replacement. Protection against subsequent treated cholera was assessed in proportional hazards models and waning of protection was assessed non-parametrically with use of smoothing of protection curves. We included 3925 index patients and 23 550 matched controls. Patients with El Tor cholera (26 subsequent episodes among 3619 index patients) had a 48·6% (95% CI 23·1 to 65·7; p=0·0012) lower risk of El Tor cholera than controls, with no evidence of waning during up to 10 years of follow-up (p=0·87). Index patients aged 5 years and older with El Tor cholera (nine subsequent episodes among 2279 index patients) were at a 61·7% (23·6 to 80·8; p=0·0065) lower risk of El Tor cholera, whereas index patients younger than 5 years with El Tor cholera (17 subsequent episodes among 1340 index patients) had a 36·2% (-5·0 to 61·3; p=0·077) lower risk (p=0·26 for the difference by age). Protection against El Tor cholera associated with previous El Tor cholera was moderate in magnitude and sustained over 10 years of follow-up. These findings suggest the potential for sustained, long-term protection by oral cholera vaccines in populations with endemic cholera and help inform models of cholera in endemic settings.

        "abstract": "Cholera rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are vulnerable to virulent bacteriophage predation. We hypothesized that an enhanced cholera RDT that detects the common virulent bacteriophage ICP1 might serve as a proxy for pathogen detection. We previously developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the ICP1 major capsid protein. Our objective was to design and assemble a first-of-its-kind RDT that detects both a bacterial pathogen (<i>Vibrio cholerae</i>) and associated virulent bacteriophage (ICP1). Candidate mAbs were expanded to increase design options and evaluated by immunological assays (ELISA; western blot). A subset of mAbs were selected for gold conjugation and printing on the RDT. The detection limit of the prototype RDTs was determined in diarrheal stools with the addition of ICP1. Three mAb candidates were developed and evaluated for the capsid decoration protein (ORF123) and tail fiber protein (ORF93), and the prior mAb for the major capsid protein (ORF122). A single mAb sandwich RDT prototype for ORF122 was able to detect ICP1; RDTs with mAbs to ORF123 and ORF93 failed to detect ICP1 in single- or dual-sandwich configurations. Biologically relevant concentrations for ICP1 were detected only after boiling the stool with ICP1; analysis by electron microscopy (EM) suggested increased epitope availability after boiling. In this study, we demonstrate a proof of concept for a functional RDT that can detect both the primary pathogen and a common virulent bacteriophage as a proxy for pathogen detection. Further optimization is required before scaled production and implementation.IMPORTANCEThis paper represents an important step forward to address the vulnerability of cholera RDTs to the effects of phage predation on the target <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. The assembly and evaluation of an RDT that detects both the primary pathogen and a phage as a proxy for the primary pathogen is an innovative solution. When optimized and evaluated in clinical studies, this tool may become critical in the cholera response tool kit as well as represent a diagnostic proof-of-concept for other infectious agents.",

        "abstract": "Bacterial infections leading to bacteremia and septicemic shock constitute an emerging public health concern globally, especially in areas where sanitation is poor and safe drinking water is scarce. Enteric pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae are responsible for many deaths caused by contaminated food and water in these areas. While cholera is the prominent clinical threat posed by V. cholerae, outcomes like bacteremia turning into sepsis and associated morbidity and mortality have been increasing globally in recent times. Here, we report an alarming case of fatal sepsis with a probable association of V. cholerae bacteremia in Bangladesh. In September 2023, a 30-year-old man with a pre-condition of beta-thalassemia presented to a tertiary care hospital with acute diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and fever and died within 36 h of admission with acute cholecystitis, metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, pancytopenia, and refractory septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. Blood culture detected V. cholerae, which was further characterized as hemolytic, carrying the hemolysin gene and genes for the virulence factor type-three secretion system. The isolate was confirmed as V. cholerae non-O1/O139 (NOVC), which differed in genetic properties from the few contemporary NOVC isolates associated with diarrheal cases in Bangladesh. To manage the diarrhea and septicemic condition, the patient was treated empirically with metronidazole and meropenem. However, antibiotic susceptibility testing showed the strain was susceptible to all the routinely prescribed drugs for V. cholerae infections. To the best of our knowledge, this investigation provides the first molecular description of a fatal case of V. cholerae-associated bacteremia in Bangladesh and underscores the need for comprehensive investigations on bacterial septicemia to prevent future casualties.",

The study used data from the Diarrheal Disease Surveillance System at Dhaka Hospital, involving 16,276 patients from 2017 to 2022. We identified 1404 ETEC-positive patients from the 16,276 data points to investigate the association between ETEC infections, co-infections, and clinical outcomes.

Adults were more likely to develop co-infections with ETEC and V. cholerae, while children under five were more likely to develop ETEC co-infections with rotavirus. Co-infections with V. cholerae, rotavirus, and Salmonella spp. increased the likelihood of fever, while ETEC co-infections with V. cholerae increased risks of vomiting, dehydration, and intravenous fluids.

They have a debilitating impact on global health with previous occurrences causing major mortalities worldwide. The adverse outcomes are not limited to health outcomes but ravage the social, economic, and political landscapes. The World Health Organization (WHO) stands at the front of the pandemic response, strategizing to contain and mitigate the impacts on humans and the environment. It also intervenes in regional disease outbreaks that pose a threat to global health through strategic technical guidance, resource allocations, and expert support. With emerging pathogens, and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, discussions are currently underway on global preparedness for a potential future pandemic. The effects of previous pandemics underscore the need to improve global health preparedness for upcoming pandemics. The WHO's July 2024 updated list of emerging pathogens serves as a potential tool to foster global health readiness for a future pandemic. It represents a change in the world's approach to emerging and re-emerging pathogens, shifting focus from specific pathogens to adopting a broader family-focused approach. This new list recognizes the shortcomings of previous lists and adopts a more forward-thinking, proactive, and flexible approach to dealing with familiar and unfamiliar pandemic risks, now incorporating 'Prototype Pathogens' and 'Pathogen X' into its risk classification. The WHO has set the pace, developing tools and guidelines for practice. This updated list of high-priority pathogens seeks to gear research and development toward combating and neutralizing the virulence of these pathogens. Recent outbreaks of Cholera, Mpox, and Dengue fever in Africa, Avian influenza (H5N2) in Mexico, Nipah virus disease in Bangladesh, and Oropouche virus in the Americas necessitate intensifying regional disease surveillance Research organizations and institutions must prioritize incorporating these tools and approaches for shared learning and collective action established during the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent public health emergencies in the Preparedness and Resilience for Emerging Threats (PRET) Initiative as outlined by WHO.",

This study examines the motility differences between filamentous and comma-shaped forms of the <i>V. cholerae</i> O1 strain under various viscosity conditions. Utilizing the El Tor strain, we induced filamentous transformation and conducted a comparative analysis with the canonical comma-shaped morphology. Our methodology involved assessing motility patterns, swimming speeds, rotation rates, kinematics, and reversal frequencies using dark-field microscopy and high-speed imaging techniques. The results show that filamentous <i>V. cholerae</i> cells retain enhanced motility in viscous environments, indicating an evolutionary adaptation for survival in varied habitats, particularly the human gastrointestinal tract. Filamentous forms exhibited increased reversal behavior at mucin interfaces, suggesting an advantage in penetrating the mucus layer. Furthermore, the presence of filamentous cells in bile-supplemented medium underscores their relevance in natural infection scenarios. This study highlights the enhanced motility of filamentous <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> in viscous environments, an adaptation that may provide a survival advantage in the human gastrointestinal tract. By demonstrating increased reversal behavior at mucin interfaces, filamentous <i>V. cholerae</i> cells exhibit a superior ability to penetrate the mucus layer, which is crucial for effective colonization and infection. Filamentous cells in bile-supplemented media further underscores their potential role in disease pathogenesis.

        "abstract": "Cholera is a diarrhoeal disease caused by <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. It remains a major public health challenge in the endemic region around the Bay of Bengal. Over decadal time scales, one lineage typically dominates the others and spreads in global pandemic waves. However, it remains unclear to what extent diverse lineages co-circulate during a single outbreak season. Defining the pool of diversity during finer time scales is important because the selective pressures that impact <i>V. cholerae</i> - namely antibiotics and phages - are dynamic on these time scales. To study the nationwide diversity of <i>V. cholerae</i>, we long-read sequenced 273 <i>V. cholerae</i> genomes from seven hospitals over one year (2018) in Bangladesh. Four major <i>V. cholerae</i> lineages were identified: known lineages BD-1, BD-2a, and BD-2b, and a novel lineage that we call BD-3. In 2022, BD-1 caused a large cholera outbreak in Dhaka, apparently outcompeting BD-2 lineages. We show that, in 2018, BD-1 was already dominant in the five northern regions, including Dhaka, consistent with an origin from India in the north. By contrast, we observed a higher diversity of lineages in the two southern regions near the coast. The four lineages differed in pangenome content, including integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) and genes involved in resistance to bacteriophages and antibiotics. Notably, BD-2a lacked an ICE and is predicted to be more sensitive to phages and antibiotics, but nevertheless persisted throughout the year-long sampling period. Genes associated with antibiotic resistance in <i>V. cholerae</i> from Bangladesh in 2006 were entirely absent from all lineages in 2018-19, suggesting shifting costs and benefits of encoding these genes. Together, our results highlight the dynamic nature of the <i>V. cholerae</i> pangenome and the geographic structure of its lineage diversity.",

        "abstract": "The August 2024 floods in Bangladesh have precipitated a major public health crisis, significantly elevating the risk of waterborne and vector-borne diseases and exacerbating existing health vulnerabilities. This disaster has impacted over 5 million people, causing widespread environmental disruption, population displacement, and strained healthcare resources. The flooding of latrines, sewage systems, and agricultural land has led to the contamination of drinking water sources, increasing the risk of cholera, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhoea, shigellosis, and hepatitis. Additionally, stagnant floodwaters have created breeding grounds for mosquitoes, thereby increasing the threat of malaria and dengue fever. The disruption of healthcare services has further compounded the crisis, delaying emergency responses and impeding access to care. The psychological impact on affected communities is profound, with mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder emerging as significant concerns. This perspective provides an analysis of these public health threats, supported by data on the impact of floods and a discussion of the underlying risk factors. This underscores the need for immediate and long-term public health interventions, including restoring clean water access, enhancing disease surveillance, repairing healthcare infrastructure, and addressing mental health needs. The response to this disaster must be rapid and comprehensive, with lessons learned to inform preparedness efforts to better manage similar events in the future.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance patterns, and risk factors linked to <i>Shigella</i> infections through a nationwide hospital-based diarrheal disease surveillance in Bangladesh. From May 2014 to May 2022, from a systematic sentinel surveillance of <i>Shigella</i> infections in over 10 hospitals across Bangladesh, stool specimens were collected from patients with acute watery diarrhea and tested for <i>Shigella</i> species by microbiological culture. The susceptibility to antibiotics was tested using the disk diffusion method. Structured questionnaires were used to collect participants' socioeconomic status and clinical, sanitation, and food history. Out of 24,357 stool specimens, 1.8% were positive for <i>Shigella</i> species, with a higher prevalence among males (58%). Children in the 6-17 age group were found to be at the highest risk of <i>Shigella</i> infections. The most prevalent serotype was <i>Shigella flexneri</i> (79.5%), followed by <i>Shigella sonnei. S. flexneri</i> serotype 2a was the most common (63.3%) among all <i>Shigella</i> serotypes. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed over 99% of isolates resistant or with intermediate susceptibility to one of the seven antibiotics tested. About 96% of <i>S. flexneri</i> and all <i>S. sonnei</i> isolates demonstrated resistance to at least one quinolone class of antibiotics, particularly ciprofloxacin or nalidixic acid. <i>S. sonnei</i> showed higher antibiotic resistance and multidrug resistance compared to <i>S. flexneri</i>. The high level of resistance to ciprofloxacin highlights the need for more prudent use of this antibiotic and improved hygiene and sanitation. The study emphasized the importance of regular monitoring of drug resistance to effectively manage <i>Shigella</i> infections. These findings may provide the epidemiological evidence for conducting future appropriate <i>Shigella</i> vaccine clinical trials in Bangladesh. This nationwide study in Bangladesh assessed <i>Shigella</i> infections from 2014 to 2022 from clinical samples. <i>S. flexneri</i> was predominant, with concerning antibiotic resistance, notably to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid in over 96% of isolates. This emphasizes the urgency of prudent antibiotic use and improved hygiene. The findings provide crucial antimicrobial resistance patterns of <i>Shigella</i> species, highlighting the need for ongoing resistance monitoring and potentially informing future vaccine trials.",

        "title": "Satellite-Derived, Smartphone-Delivered Geospatial Cholera Risk Information for Vulnerable Populations.",
        "abstract": "Cholera, an acute waterborne diarrheal disease, remains a major global health challenge. Despite being curable and preventable, it can be fatal if left untreated, especially for children. Bangladesh, a cholera-endemic country with a high disease burden, experiences two peaks annually, during the dry pre-monsoon spring and the wet post-monsoon fall seasons. An early warning system for disseminating cholera risk, which has potential to reduce the disease burden, currently does not exist in Bangladesh. Such systems can raise timely awareness and allow households in rural, riverine areas like Matlab to make behavioral adjustments with water usage and around water resources to reduce contracting and transmitting cholera. Current dissemination approaches typically target local government and public health organizations; however, the vulnerable rural populations largely remain outside the information chain. Here, we develop and evaluate the accuracy of an early warning system-CholeraMap that uses high-resolution earth observations to forecast cholera risk and disseminate geocoded risk maps directly to Matlab's population via a mobile smartphone application. Instead of relying on difficult to obtain station-based environmental and hydroclimatological data, this study offers a new opportunity to use remote sensing data sets for designing and operating a disease early warning system. CholeraMap delivers monthly, color-coded geospatial maps (1 km × 1 km spatial resolution) with household and community cholera risk information. Our results demonstrate that the satellite-derived local-scale risk model satisfactorily captured the seasonal cholera pattern for the Matlab region, and a detailed high-resolution picture of the spatial progression of at-risk areas during outbreak months.",

        "abstract": "Severe dehydration due to acute infectious diarrhea remains a leading cause of death among young children worldwide. Diarrhea with severe dehydration is a clinical syndrome with distinct management per the World Health Organization (WHO) Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) and the WHO Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) guidelines. We sought to characterize the pathogens causing severe dehydration using data from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study. We used the IMCI and GTFCC guidelines to define severe dehydration and quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based attribution models to assign the etiology of diarrhea associated with severe dehydration. The IMCI or GTFCC guidelines classified 2284 of the 5304 (43%) cases with moderate-to-severe diarrhea as having severe dehydration. In one-third of the cases with severe dehydration, no pathogens were attributed. The top pathogens attributed to children with guidelines-classified severe dehydration varied by age and were similar among those requiring intravenous hydration and hospitalization. Rotavirus (30.9%), <i>Cryptosporidium</i> (12.0%), and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC) (10.3%) were the most common pathogens for ages 0-11 months, while <i>Shigella</i>/enteroinvasive <i>E coli</i> (EIEC) (25.8%), rotavirus (19.3%), and ST-ETEC (10.9%) were the most common for ages 12-23 months. <i>Shigella</i>/EIEC (25.9%), <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> (10.4%), and rotavirus (9.2%) were the most common among ages 24-59 months. The findings inform prioritization of pathogens, in addition to <i>V cholerae</i>, that cause severe dehydration for future preventive and treatment efforts.

        "abstract": "Bacteria and phages are locked in a co-evolutionary arms race where each entity evolves mechanisms to restrict the proliferation of the other. Phage-encoded defense inhibitors have proven powerful tools to interrogate how defense systems function. A relatively common defense system is BREX (bacteriophage exclusion); however, how BREX functions to restrict phage infection remains poorly understood. A BREX system encoded by the <u>s</u>ulfametho<u>x</u>azole and <u>t</u>rimethoprim (SXT) integrative and conjugative element, <i>Vch</i>Ind5, was recently identified in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera. The lytic phage ICP1 (<u>I</u>nternational Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh <u>c</u>holera <u>p</u>hage <u>1</u>) that co-circulates with <i>V. cholerae</i> encodes the BREX-inhibitor OrbA, but how OrbA inhibits BREX is unclear. Here, we determine that OrbA inhibits BREX using a unique mechanism from known BREX inhibitors by directly binding to the BREX component BrxC. BrxC has a functional ATPase domain that, when mutated, not only disrupts BrxC function but also alters how BrxC multimerizes. Furthermore, we find that OrbA binding disrupts BrxC-BrxC interactions. We determine that OrbA cannot bind BrxC encoded by the distantly related BREX system encoded by the aSXT <i>Vch</i>Ban9, and thus fails to inhibit this BREX system that also circulates in epidemic <i>V. cholerae</i>. Lastly, we find that homologs of the <i>Vch</i>Ind5 BrxC are more diverse than the homologs of the <i>Vch</i>Ban9 BrxC. These data provide new insight into the function of the BrxC ATPase and highlight how phage-encoded inhibitors can disrupt phage defense systems using different mechanisms.IMPORTANCEWith renewed interest in phage therapy to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens, understanding the mechanisms bacteria use to defend themselves against phages and the counter-strategies phages evolve to inhibit defenses is paramount. Bacteriophage exclusion (BREX) is a common defense system with few known inhibitors. Here, we probe how the vibriophage-encoded inhibitor OrbA inhibits the BREX system of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera. By interrogating OrbA function, we have begun to understand the importance and function of a BREX component. Our results demonstrate the importance of identifying inhibitors against defense systems, as they are powerful tools for dissecting defense activity and can inform strategies to increase the efficacy of some phage therapies.",

        "abstract": "Epidemiological studies on amoebic infections are complicated due to morphologically identical and clinically important Entamoeba species. Therefore, newer, simpler, and more economical diagnostic techniques are required for differentiating clinically important Entamoeba species. We developed a single-round multiplex PCR assay to identify E. histolytica, E. moshkovskii, E. dispar, E. bangladeshi, and E. coli. Primers were designed based on variations in 18 S rRNA sequences. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed using known positive and negative samples. Furthermore, we screened 472 diarrheal samples using this technique alongside the reference PCR method to evaluate its suitability for epidemiological studies and clinical diagnosis. DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the isolates were conducted. All statistical analyses of the data were performed using GraphPad Prism. The designed primers successfully yielded species-specific PCR products of different sizes as expected. We did not observe any non-specific amplifications of the primer set. The diagnostic performance was also convincing. After screening clinical samples using the method, we observed that 2.33% (n = 11) tested positive for E. moshkovskii, 1.06% (n = 5) tested positive for E. histolytica, and 0.85% (n = 4) tested positive for E. bangladeshi in the studied area. DNA sequencing further confirmed the identified species. The constructed phylogenetic tree also demonstrated clear separation of the detected species lineages. The study suggests the multiplex PCR assay could be a reliable diagnostic tool for amoebic infections. This study is particularly significant as it marks the first reported occurrence of E. bangladeshi since its documentation in South Africa and its native Bangladesh.",

        "abstract": "Suboptimal water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices constitute a serious public health risk, affecting one-third of the world's population. Remarkable progress has been made to improve WASH; however, challenges remain, with rapid population growth adding pressure on WASH systems. This study explores the current state of WASH practices and diseases in Africa, identifies challenges, and proposes public health recommendations for sustainable implementation. The staggering burden of WASH-related diseases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in Africa, threatens public health, with millions of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributed to poor WASH practices annually. Notable challenges plaguing WASH practices in the region include poverty, malnutrition, poor data reporting, illiteracy, climate change, and poor healthcare financing. This results in adverse health consequences, including waterborne infections like cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and diarrheal diseases. Additionally, neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as intestinal worms, schistosomiasis, trachoma, lost productivity, and environmental pollution from soil and underground water contamination have been implicated. Geographical disparities, cultural norms, and inadequate funding further complicate efforts to improve WASH infrastructure and practices. Globally concerted efforts are required to address these issues and permit WASH practices to protect human health by preventing infectious diseases and contributing to economic growth. Strong financial frameworks, skills training, and tools like WASH Fit are recommended for a stronger WASH approach in Africa. The consequences of poor WASH extend beyond public health, impacting economic growth, gender equality, and environmental sustainability.

        "abstract": "Diverse bacterial group behaviors are controlled by quorum sensing, a regulatory network of bacterial gene expression based on cell density, and involving communication through chemical signal molecules called autoinducers. Multidisciplinary research in toxigenic Vibrio cholerae the etiologic agent of cholera, appear to suggest group behavior in the ecology, epidemiology, pathogenesis and transmission of the pathogen. This review summarizes latest advances and known aspects of quorum regulated environmental survival form of V. cholerae, and their role in cholera outbreaks, as well as the significance of this knowledge in tracking the pathogen for prevention of cholera. Pathogenic V. cholerae naturally exists in aquatic reservoirs, and infects humans, often leading to epidemic outbreaks of cholera. Effective detection and monitoring of the pathogen in surface waters have been a research focus in preventing cholera outbreaks. However, in the aquatic reservoirs, V. cholerae persists mostly in a quiescent state referred to as viable but non-culturable (VBNC), or conditionally viable environmental cells (CVEC), which fail to grow in routine bacteriological culture. The presence of CVEC can, however, be observed by fluorescent antibody based microscopy, and they appear as clumps of cells embedded in an exopolysaccharide matrix. Current studies suggest that CVEC found in water are derived from in-vivo formed biofilms excreted by cholera patients. The transition to CVEC occurs when dilution of autoinducers in water blocks quorum-mediated regulatory responses that would normally disperse the cellular aggregates. Consequently, CVEC are resuscitated to actively growing cells if autoinducers are replenished, either in the laboratory, or naturally by other environmental bacteria or the intestinal microbiota when CVEC are ingested by humans or aquatic animals. Quorum sensing plays a crucial role in the environmental persistence of toxigenic V. cholerae in a latent state, and their periodic emergence to cause cholera outbreaks. Furthermore, the autoinducer driven resuscitation of these cells may be a basis for improving the detection of V. cholerae in water samples, and monitoring V. cholerae in their aquatic reservoirs in cholera endemic areas.",

We analysed in-patients isolates from six Bangladeshi regions (2015-2021), and uncovered accessory genes and core SNPs unique to the most recent dominant lineage, with virulence, motility and bacteriophage resistance functions. We also found a strong correlation between V. cholerae genomic traits and disease severity, with some traits overlapping those driving lineage transmission. GSMM and 3D structure analysis unveiled a complex interplay between transcription regulation, protein interaction and stability, and metabolic networks, associated to lifestyle adaptation, intestinal colonization, acid tolerance and symptom severity.

Assessing the risk, cholera surveillance network was established with the aim to identify the outbreak of diarrhea and cholera and help to take appropriate preventive measures including a vaccination campaign. The surveillance network has been ongoing for 6 years (2017-2023) in 17 health facilities. Diarrhea patients from Rohingya Myanmar nationals matched with case definition were enrolled and stool samples were tested by Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for early cholera detection Multiple Logistic regression models were fitted to examine the associations of risk factors among cholera cases. A total of 17,252 stool samples were collected through surveillance. Among the tested samples, 588 (3.5 %) were detected positive by RDT, and 239 (1.4 %) <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> were isolated by microbiological culture.

Although ETEC are associated with long-term sequelae including malnutrition, the acute diarrheal illness is largely self-limited. Recent studies indicate that in addition to causing diarrhea, the ETEC heat-labile toxin (LT) modulates the expression of many genes in intestinal epithelia, including carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) which ETEC exploit as receptors, enabling toxin delivery. Here, however, we demonstrate that LT also enhances the expression of CEACAMs on extracellular vesicles (EV) shed by intestinal epithelia and that CEACAM-laden EV increase in abundance during human infections, mitigate pathogen-host interactions, scavenge free ETEC toxins, and accelerate ETEC clearance from the gastrointestinal tract. Collectively, these findings indicate that CEACAMs play a multifaceted role in ETEC pathogen-host interactions, transiently favoring the pathogen, but ultimately contributing to innate responses that extinguish these common infections.",

        "title": "Estimating time-varying cholera transmission and oral cholera vaccine effectiveness in Haiti and Cameroon, 2021-2023.",
        "abstract": "In 2023, cholera affected approximately 1 million people and caused more than 5000 deaths globally, predominantly in low-income and conflict settings. In recent years, the number of new cholera outbreaks has grown rapidly. Further, ongoing cholera outbreaks have been exacerbated by conflict, climate change, and poor infrastructure, resulting in prolonged crises. As a result, the demand for treatment and intervention is quickly outpacing existing resource availability. Prior to improved water and sanitation systems, cholera, a disease primarily transmitted via contaminated water sources, also routinely ravaged high-income countries. Crumbling infrastructure and climate change are now putting new locations at risk - even in high-income countries. Thus, understanding the transmission and prevention of cholera is critical. Combating cholera requires multiple interventions, the two most common being behavioral education and water treatment. Two-dose oral cholera vaccination (OCV) is often used as a complement to these interventions. Due to limited supply, countries have recently switched to single-dose vaccines (OCV1). One challenge lies in understanding where to allocate OCV1 in a timely manner, especially in settings lacking well-resourced public health surveillance systems. As cholera occurs and propagates in such locations, timely, accurate, and openly accessible outbreak data are typically inaccessible for disease modeling and subsequent decision-making. In this study, we demonstrated the value of open-access data to rapidly estimate cholera transmission and vaccine effectiveness. Specifically, we obtained non-machine readable (NMR) epidemic curves for recent cholera outbreaks in two countries, Haiti and Cameroon, from figures published in situation and disease outbreak news reports. We used computational digitization techniques to derive weekly counts of cholera cases, resulting in nominal differences when compared against the reported cumulative case counts (i.e., a relative error rate of 5.67% in Haiti and 0.54% in Cameroon). Given these digitized time series, we leveraged EpiEstim-an open-source modeling platform-to derive rapid estimates of time-varying disease transmission via the effective reproduction number ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msub><mi>R</mi> <mi>t</mi></msub> </mrow> </math> ). To compare OCV1 effectiveness in the two considered countries, we additionally used VaxEstim, a recent extension of EpiEstim that facilitates the estimation of vaccine effectiveness via the relation among three inputs: the basic reproduction number ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msub><mi>R</mi> <mstyle><mn>0</mn></mstyle> </msub> </mrow> </math> ), <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msub><mi>R</mi> <mi>t</mi></msub> </mrow> </math> , and vaccine coverage. Here, with Haiti and Cameroon as case studies, we demonstrated the first implementation of VaxEstim in low-resource settings. Importantly, we are the first to use VaxEstim with digitized data rather than traditional epidemic surveillance data. In the initial phase of the outbreak, weekly rolling average estimates of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msub><mi>R</mi> <mi>t</mi></msub> </mrow> </math> were elevated in both countries: 2.60 in Haiti [95% credible interval: 2.42-2.79] and 1.90 in Cameroon [1.14-2.95]. These values are largely consistent with previous estimates of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msub><mi>R</mi> <mstyle><mn>0</mn></mstyle> </msub> </mrow> </math> in Haiti, where average values have ranged from 1.06 to 3.72, and in Cameroon, where average values have ranged from 1.10 to 3.50. In both Haiti and Cameroon, this initial period of high transmission preceded a longer period during which <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow><msub><mi>R</mi> <mi>t</mi></msub> </mrow> </math> oscillated around the critical threshold of 1. Our results derived from VaxEstim suggest that Haiti had higher OCV1 effectiveness than Cameroon (75.32% effective [54.00-86.39%] vs. 54.88% [18.94-84.90%]). These estimates of OCV1 effectiveness are generally aligned with those derived from field studies conducted in other countries. Thus, our case study reinforces the validity of VaxEstim as an alternative to costly, time-consuming field studies of OCV1 effectiveness. Indeed, prior work in South Sudan, Bangladesh, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported OCV1 effectiveness ranging from approximately 40% to 80%. This work underscores the value of combining NMR sources of outbreak case data with computational techniques and the utility of VaxEstim for rapid, inexpensive estimation of vaccine effectiveness in data-poor outbreak settings.",

        "abstract": "Enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC) cause hundreds of millions of diarrheal illnesses annually ranging from mildly symptomatic cases to severe, life-threatening cholera-like diarrhea. Although ETEC are associated with long-term sequelae including malnutrition, the acute diarrheal illness is largely self-limited. Recent studies indicate that in addition to causing diarrhea, the ETEC heat-labile toxin (LT) modulates the expression of many genes in intestinal epithelia, including carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) which ETEC exploit as receptors, enabling toxin delivery. Here however, we demonstrate that LT also enhances the expression of CEACAMs on extracellular vesicles (EV) shed by intestinal epithelia and that CEACAM-laden EV increase in abundance during human infections, mitigate pathogen-host interactions, scavenge free ETEC toxins, and accelerate ETEC clearance from the gastrointestinal tract. Collectively, these findings indicate that CEACAMs play a multifaceted role in ETEC pathogen-host interactions, transiently favoring the pathogen, but ultimately contributing to innate responses that extinguish these common infections.",

        "abstract": "Explanations for the genesis and propagation of cholera pandemics since 1817 have remained elusive. Evolutionary pathogen change is presumed to have been a dominant factor behind the 7th \"El Tor\" pandemic, but little is known to support this hypothesis for preceding pandemics. The role of anomalous climate in facilitating strain replacements has never been assessed. The question is of relevance to guide the understanding of infectious disease emergence today and in the context of climate change. We investigate the roles of climate and putative strain variation for the 6th cholera pandemic (1899-1923) using newly assembled historical records for climate variables and cholera deaths in provinces of former British India. We compare this historical pandemic with the 7th (El Tor) one and with the temporary emergence of the O139 strain in Bangladesh and globally. With statistical methods for nonlinear time series analysis, we examine the regional synchrony of outbreaks and associations of the disease with regional temperature and rainfall, and with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). To establish future expectations and evaluate climate anomalies accompanying historical strain replacements, climate projections are generated with multi-model climate simulations for different 50-year periods. The 6th cholera pandemic featured the striking synchronisation of cholera outbreaks over Bengal during the El Niño event of 1904-07, following the invasion of the Bombay Presidency with a delay of a few years. Accompanying anomalous weather conditions are similar to those related to ENSO during strain replacements and pandemic expansions into Africa and South America in the late 20th century. Rainfall anomalies of 1904-05 at the beginning of the large cholera anomaly fall in the 99th percentile of simulated changes for the regional climate. Evolutionary pathogen change can act synergistically with climatic conditions in the emergence and propagation of cholera strains. Increased climate variability and extremes under global warming provide windows of opportunity for emerging pathogens.",

Notably, some phages, including the Vibrio cholerae-infecting ICP1 (International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh cholera phage 1), harbor CRISPR-Cas systems to counteract host defenses. Nevertheless, ICP1 Cas8f lacks the helical bundle domain essential for recruitment of helicase-nuclease Cas2/3 during target DNA cleavage and how this system accomplishes the interference stage remains unknown. Here, we found that Cas1, a highly conserved component known to exclusively work in the adaptation stage, also mediates the interference stage through connecting Cas2/3 to the DNA-bound CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense (Cascade; CRISPR system yersinia, Csy) of the ICP1 CRISPR-Cas system. A series of structures of Csy, Csy-dsDNA (double-stranded DNA), Cas1-Cas2/3 and Csy-dsDNA-Cas1-Cas2/3 complexes reveal the whole process of Cas1-mediated target DNA cleavage by the ICP1 CRISPR-Cas system. Together, these data support an unprecedented model in which Cas1 mediates the interference stage in a phage-encoded CRISPR-Cas system and the study also sheds light on a unique model of primed adaptation.",

        "abstract": "Traditional medicine (TM) interventions are plausible therapeutic alternatives to conventional medical interventions against emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases, particularly in low-and middle-income countries that may lack resources and infrastructure. Despite the growing popularity in the usage of TM interventions, their clinical safety and effectiveness are still contested within conventional healthcare in many countries. We conducted a scoping review of the peer-reviewed literature that synthesises and maps the evidence on TM interventions for the treatment and prevention of zoonoses on the Indian subcontinent. The region, a global hotspot of biodiversity and emerging infections, is characterised by high prevalence of TM use. Based on the scientific literature (mostly case study research, n=l06 studies), our review (1) maps the scope of the literature, (2) synthesises the evidence on the application of TM interventions for zoonoses, and (3) critically reflects on the state of TM and identifies areas for future research focus. The evidence synthesis confirmed widespread usage of TM interventions for zoonoses on the subcontinent, with the majority of research reported from India (n=99 studies, 93.4%), followed by Pakistan (n=3 studies, 2.8%), Bangladesh (n=2 studies, 1.9%), and Sri Lanka (n=1, 0.9%). Most of the reviewed studies reported on ethno-medicinal uses of plant species, primarily for treating dengue (n=20 studies), tuberculosis (n=18 studies), Escherichia coli infection (n=16 studies), lymphatic filariasis and cholera (n=9 apiece). However, the evidence on the safety and effectiveness of these reported TM interventions is limited, indicating that these data are rarely collected and/or shared within the peer-reviewed literature. This review thus highlights that, whilst TMs are already being used and could offer more widely accessible interventions against emerging and endemic zoonoses and ectoparasites, there is an urgent need for rigorous clinical testing and validation of the safety and effectiveness of these interventions.",

        "abstract": "<i>Vibrio cholerae</i> O1 causes the diarrheal disease cholera, and the small intestine is the site of active infection. During cholera, cholera toxin is secreted from <i>V. cholerae</i> and induces a massive fluid influx into the small intestine, which causes vomiting and diarrhea. Typically, <i>V. cholerae</i> genomes are sequenced from bacteria passed in stool, but rarely from vomit, a fluid that may more closely represents the site of active infection. We hypothesized that <i>V. cholerae</i> O1 population bottlenecks along the gastrointestinal tract would result in reduced genetic variation in stool compared to vomit. To test this, we sequenced <i>V. cholerae</i> genomes from 10 cholera patients with paired vomit and stool samples. Genetic diversity was low in both vomit and stool, consistent with a single infecting population rather than coinfection with divergent <i>V. cholerae</i> O1 lineages. The amount of single-nucleotide variation decreased from vomit to stool in four patients, increased in two, and remained unchanged in four. The variation in gene presence/absence decreased between vomit and stool in eight patients and increased in two. Pangenome analysis of assembled short-read sequencing demonstrated that the toxin-coregulated pilus operon more frequently contained deletions in genomes from vomit compared to stool. However, these deletions were not detected by PCR or long-read sequencing, indicating that interpreting gene presence or absence patterns from short-read data alone may be incomplete. Overall, we found that <i>V. cholerae</i> O1 isolated from stool is genetically similar to <i>V. cholerae</i> recovered from the upper intestinal tract. <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> O1, the bacterium that causes cholera, is ingested in contaminated food or water and then colonizes the upper small intestine and is excreted in stool. Shed <i>V. cholerae</i> genomes from stool are usually studied, but <i>V. cholerae</i> isolated from vomit may be more representative of where <i>V. cholerae</i> colonizes in the upper intestinal epithelium. <i>V. cholerae</i> may experience bottlenecks, or large reductions in bacterial population sizes and genetic diversity, as it passes through the gut. Passage through the gut may select for distinct <i>V. cholerae</i> mutants that are adapted for survival and gut colonization. We did not find strong evidence for such adaptive mutations, and instead observed that passage through the gut results in modest reductions in <i>V. cholerae</i> genetic diversity, and only in some patients. These results fill a gap in our understanding of the <i>V. cholerae</i> life cycle, transmission, and evolution.",

        "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (Salmonella Typhi) causes severe and occasionally life-threatening disease, transmitted through contaminated food and water. Humans are the only reservoir, inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure increases risk of typhoid. High-quality data to assess spatial and temporal relationships in disease dynamics are scarce. We analyzed data from a prospective cohort conducted in an urban slum area of Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Passive surveillance at study centers identified typhoid cases by microbiological culture. Each incident case (index case) was matched to two randomly selected index controls, and we measured typhoid incidence in the population residing in a geographically defined region surrounding each case and control. Spatial clustering was evaluated by comparing the typhoid incidence in residents of geometric rings of increasing radii surrounding the index cases and controls over 28 days. Temporal clustering was evaluated by separately measuring incidence in the first and second 14-day periods following selection. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated using Poisson regression models. We evaluated 141 typhoid index cases. The overall typhoid incidence was 0.44 per 100,000 person-days (PDs) (95% CI: 0.40, 0.49). In the 28 days following selection, the highest typhoid incidence (1.2 per 100,000 PDs [95% CI: 0.8, 1.6]) was in the innermost cluster surrounding index cases. The IRR in this innermost cluster was 4.9 (95% CI: 2.4, 10.3) relative to the innermost control clusters. Neither typhoid incidence rates nor relative IRR between index case and control populations showed substantive differences in the first and second 14-day periods after selection. In the absence of routine immunization programs, geographic clustering of typhoid cases suggests a higher intensity of typhoid risk in the population immediately surrounding identified cases. Further studies are needed to understand spatial and temporal trends and to evaluate the effectiveness of targeted vaccination in disrupting typhoid transmission.",

        "abstract": "Enteric viral pathogens are associated with a significant burden of childhood morbidity and mortality. We investigated the relationship between viral pathogens and child growth among under-5 children. We analyzed data from 5572/22,567 children enrolled in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study across seven study sites (2007-2011). Multiple linear regression was used to examine the association between the viral pathogens and changes of length/height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-length/height (WHZ) z-scores, stratified by diarrheal symptoms and adjusted for potential covariates. Rotavirus (18.51%) and norovirus (7.33%) were the most prevalent enteric viral pathogens among symptomatic and asymptomatic under-5 children, respectively. Infection with individual enteric viral pathogens hurts child growth in asymptomatic children. However, the relationship with HAZ was less clear and statistically non-significant. On the other hand, the combined viral pathogens demonstrated a strong negative influence on child growth [WAZ: β coef.: - 0.10 (95%, CI - 0.15, - 0.05); P < 0.001 and WHZ: β: - 0.12 (95% CI - 0.17, - 0.07); P < 0.001] among asymptomatic children. Infection with any viral pathogen was associated with growth shortfalls [HAZ: β: - 0.05 (95% CI - 0.09, 0.00); P = 0.03 and WAZ: β: - 0.11 (95% CI - 0.16, - 0.07); P < 0.001 and WHZ: β: - 0.13 (95% CI - 0.18, - 0.09); P < 0.001], though the relationship with HAZ was less evident and became statistically non-significant in older children. Notably, among symptomatic children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea, individual enteric viral pathogens, as well as the combined effects of these pathogens [WHZ: β: 0.07; (95% CI 0.01, 0.14); P = 0.03] and the presence of any virus [HAZ: β: 0.09 (95% CI 0.05, 0.13) & WAZ: β: 0.08 (95% CI 0.03, 0.12); P < 0.001], exhibited positive effects on child growth. While previous studies hypothesized that several viral pathogens had a conflicting controversial role in child growth, we find clear indications that enteric viral pathogens are associated with growth shortfalls, specifically among asymptomatic children. These findings highlight the need for preventive strategies targeting children with enteric viral pathogens, which could address the consequences of growth faltering.",

        "abstract": "Diarrhoeal disease poses a significant global health challenge, especially in children under three years old. Despite the effectiveness of oral rehydration therapy (ORT), its adoption remains low. Glucose-based ORS (GORS) is the standard, but novel formulations like glucose-free amino acid-based VS002A have emerged as potential alternatives. This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of VS002A against the standard WHO-ORS in treating non-cholera acute watery diarrhoea in children. A triple-blind, randomized trial enrolled 310 male infants and children aged 6-36 months, who were assigned to receive WHO-ORS or VS002A over a 16-month period, from June 2021 to September 2022. Both groups received standard of care, including zinc supplementation. The Primary study outcome measured was the duration of diarrhoea. Secondary outcomes included stool output, treatment failure and adverse events. Exploratory endpoints included urinary output, body weight changes, blood biochemistry, stool microbiology and gut health biomarkers. Both VS002A and WHO-ORS were well-tolerated with a low adverse event rate. While not different statistically (p = 0.10), duration of diarrhoea was shorter in children treated with VS002A vs. WHO-ORS (65.4 h vs. 72.6 h). Similarly, stool output was also lower vs. WHO-ORS in children treated with VS002A, though not statistically different (p = 0.40). Serum citrulline levels, an indicator of gut health, were higher in the VS002A group at 24 h suggesting a potential protective effect (p = 0.06). The findings of this study support the non-inferiority of VS002A, a glucose-free amino acid-based ORS compared to the WHO-ORS standard of care. VS002A was shown to be safe and effective in treating non-cholera acute watery diarrhoea in young children. VS002A may offer advantages in pathogen-driven diarrhoea, supported by trends toward a lower duration of diarrhoea and stool output within the per protocol group. Furthermore, individuals with prolonged diarrhoea, severe malnutrition, environmental enteric dysfunction or have issues with obesity or insulin resistance, could benefit from a glucose-free ORS. This research contributes to addressing the persistent challenge of childhood diarrhoea by presenting an alternative glucose-free ORS formulation with potential advantages in select scenarios, offering a promising avenue for improving paediatric diarrhoea management worldwide.

Different literatures analyzed presentation and outcomes of less than five diarrhoeal children. The world has made remarkable progress in reducing child mortality. So, older children are growing in number. Our aim was to identify clinical differentials and variations of pathogens among younger (less than five) and older (five to nine years) diarrhoeal children. Data were extracted from the diarrhoeal disease surveillance system (DDSS) of Dhaka Hospital (urban site) and Matlab Hospital (rural site) of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh for the period of January 2012 to December 2021. Out of 28,781 and 12,499 surveillance patients in Dhaka and Matlab Hospital, 614 (2.13%) and 278 (2.22%) children were five to nine-years of age, respectively. Among under five children, 2456 from Dhaka hospital and 1112 from Matlab hospital were selected randomly for analysis (four times of five to nine years age children, 1:4). Vomiting, abdominal pain, and dehydrating diarrhoea were significantly higher in older children in comparison to children of less than five years age (p-value <0.05) after adjusting study site, gender, antibiotic use before hospitalization, diarrhoeal duration < 24 hours, intake of oral rehydration fluid at home, parental education, WASH practice and history of cough. Vibrio. cholerae, Salmonella, and Shigella were the common fecal pathogen observed among older children compared to under five after adjusting for age, gender and study site. Although percentage of admitted diarrhoeal children with five to nine years is less than under five years children but they presented with critical illness with different diarrhoeal pathogens. These observations may help clinicians to formulate better case management strategies for children of five to nine years that may reduce morbidity.",

Despite the growing aquaculture industry in Bangladesh to meet high demand, little attention has been paid to ensuring the safety of fish. The objective of this study was to evaluate the microbiological quality of tilapia and pangas fish sold in retail markets across Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Specifically, the study aimed to compare the quality of fish from traditional wet markets and modern supermarkets, as well as fish samples collected during morning and evening hours. A total of 500 raw cut-fish samples (250 tilapia and 250 pangas) were collected at the point of sale from 32 wet markets and 25 supermarkets. All samples were tested for Escherichia coli, extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli (ESBL-Ec), along with the foodborne pathogens Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, and Cryptosporidium spp. Bacterial isolates were characterized using antibiotic susceptibility tests (AST) and the presence of common virulence and antibiotic-resistant genes. Fish samples from retail markets had higher prevalence of tested bacteria including E. coli (92 %), V. cholerae (62 %), ESBL-Ec (48 %), and Salmonella spp. (24 %). There was a significant difference in the prevalence of E. coli (97 % vs. 71 %), ESBL-Ec (58 % vs. 8 %) and Salmonella spp. (28 % vs. 8 %) on the wet market samples compared to supermarket samples (p < 0.005). The mean concentration of E. coli on fish from the wet market was 3.0 ± 0.9 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g, while that from supermarkets was 1.6 ± 0.9 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g. The mean concentration of ESBL-Ec in fish from wet markets and supermarkets were 2.3 ± 0.8 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g and 1.6 ± 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g, respectively. AST revealed that 46 % of E. coli isolates were multi-drug resistant (MDR), while 4 %, 2 % and 5 % of E. coli, Salmonella spp. and Vibrio spp. isolates, respectively, were resistant to carbapenems. At least 3 % of total E. coli isolates were found to be diarrheagenic, while 40 % of Salmonella isolates harbored pathogenic genes (stn, bcfC, ssaQ, avrA and sodC1), and none of the V. cholerae isolates harbored ctxA and tcpA. Our research shows that raw-cut fish samples from retail markets are contaminated with pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which could be a significant food safety concern. Public health interventions should be implemented to improve food safety and hygiene practices in the retail fish markets.",

Virulent phage (ICP1) and antibiotics suppressed <i>V. cholerae</i> to varying degrees and were inversely associated with severe dehydration depending on resistance mechanisms. In the absence of antiphage defenses, predation was \"effective,\" with a high predator:prey ratio that correlated with increased genetic diversity among the prey. In the presence of antiphage defenses, predation was \"ineffective,\" with a lower predator:prey ratio that correlated with increased genetic diversity among the predators. Phage-bacteria coevolution within patients should therefore be considered in the deployment of phage-based therapies and diagnostics.",

We compared the clinical severity using the modified Vesikari score (mVS) of enteric viruses detected by conventional assays (enzyme immunoassays [EIAs] for rotavirus and adenovirus 40/41 and conventional polymerase chain reaction for astrovirus, sapovirus, and norovirus) and a quantitative molecular assay (TaqMan Array Card [TAC]) among children aged 0-59 months in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study. For rotavirus and adenovirus 40/41, we compared severity between EIA-positive and TAC-positive cases assigned etiologies using different cycle threshold (Ct) cutoffs. Using conventional assays, the median mVS (interquartile range) was 10 (8-11) for rotavirus, 9 (7-11) for adenovirus 40/41, 8 (6-10) for astrovirus, sapovirus, and norovirus GII, and 7 (6-9) for norovirus GI. Compared with rotavirus EIA-positive cases, the median mVS was 2 and 3 points lower for EIA-negative/TAC-positive cases with Ct <32.6 or Ct ≥32.6 and <35, respectively (P < .001). Adenovirus 40/41 EIA-positive and EIA-negative/TAC-positive cases were similar, regardless of Ct cutoff. Quantitative molecular assays compared with conventional assays, such as EIA, may influence the severity of identified cases, especially for rotavirus.

        "abstract": "An upsurge of diarrheal cases occurred in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with approximately 30% of the cases being identified as cholera in 2022. To combat this situation, a reactive Oral Cholera Vaccination campaign was organized in five highly cholera-affected areas of Dhaka city. The paper is a descriptive tale of experience gathering, organization and implementation of reactive oral cholera vaccination campaign. This is a descriptive report of a reactive oral cholera vaccination campaign. Population density maps were generated using GIS technology before launching the campaign. The target population comprised individuals aged over one year, excluding pregnant women, totaling 2,374,976 people residing in above mentioned areas. The campaign utilized Euvichol-Plus, an OCV with adherence to the necessary cold chain requirements. Total 700 teams, each consisting of six members, were deployed across the five zones. The campaign was conducted in two rounds, where first round took place in June-July 2022, followed by second round in August 2022. During the campaign, data on adverse events following immunization (AEFI) was collected. Expert teams from various government and non-government organizations monitored regularly and ensured the campaign's success. The first round achieved a coverage rate of 99%, whereas in the second round, 86.3% of individuals among the first dose recipients. During the campaigns, a total of 57 AEFIs were reported. This campaign serves as a model for a multispectral approach in combating cholera epidemics, highlighting the collaborative efforts of policymakers, health authorities, local communities, and health partners.",

        "abstract": "Vaccination is important to prevent cholera. There are limited data comparing anti-O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) and anti-cholera toxin-specific immune responses following oral whole-cell with cholera toxin B-subunit (WC-rBS) vaccine (Dukoral, Valneva) administration in different age groups. An understanding of the differences is relevant because young children are less well protected by oral cholera vaccines than older children and adults. We compared responses in 50 adults and 49 children (ages 2 to <18) who were administered two doses of WC-rBS at a standard 14-day interval. All age groups had significant IgA and IgG plasma-blast responses to the OSP and cholera toxin B-subunit (CtxB) antigens that peaked 7 days after vaccination. However, in adults and older children (ages 5 to <18), antibody responses directed at the OSP antigen were largely IgA and IgG, with a minimal IgM response, while younger children (ages 2 to <5) mounted significant increases in IgM with minimal increases in IgA and IgG antibody responses 30 days after vaccination. In adults, anti-OSP and CtxB memory B-cell responses were detected after completion of the vaccination series, while children only mounted CtxB-specific IgG memory B-cell responses and no OSP-memory B-cell responses. In summary, children and adults living in a cholera endemic area mounted different responses to the WC-rBS vaccine, which may be a result of more prior exposure to <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> in older participants. The absence of class-switched antibody responses and memory B-cell responses to OSP may explain why protection wanes more rapidly after vaccination in young children compared to older vaccinees.IMPORTANCEVaccination is an important strategy to prevent cholera. Though immune responses targeting the OSP of <i>V. cholerae</i> are believed to mediate protection against cholera, there are limited data on anti-OSP responses after vaccination in different age groups, which is important as young children are not well protected by current oral cholera vaccines. In this study, we found that adults mounted memory B-cell responses to OSP, which were not seen in children. Adults and older children mounted class-switched (IgG and IgA) serum antibody responses to OSP, which were not seen in young children who had only IgM responses to OSP. The lack of class-switched antibody responses and memory B-cell responses to OSP in younger participants may be due to lack of prior exposure to <i>V. cholerae</i> and could explain why protection wanes more rapidly after vaccination in young children.",

        "abstract": "Our understanding of cholera transmission and burden largely relies on clinic-based surveillance, which can obscure trends, bias burden estimates and limit the impact of targeted cholera-prevention measures. Serological surveillance provides a complementary approach to monitoring infections, although the link between serologically derived infections and medically attended disease incidence-shaped by immunological, behavioral and clinical factors-remains poorly understood. We unravel this cascade in a cholera-endemic Bangladeshi community by integrating clinic-based surveillance, healthcare-seeking and longitudinal serological data through statistical modeling. Combining the serological trajectories with a reconstructed incidence timeline of symptomatic cholera, we estimated an annual Vibrio cholerae O1 infection incidence rate of 535 per 1,000 population (95% credible interval 514-556), with incidence increasing by age group. Clinic-based surveillance alone underestimated the number of infections and reported cases were not consistently correlated with infection timing. Of the infections, 4 in 3,280 resulted in symptoms, only 1 of which was reported through the surveillance system. These results impart insights into cholera transmission dynamics and burden in the epicenter of the seventh cholera pandemic, where >50% of our study population had an annual V. cholerae O1 infection, and emphasize the potential for a biased view of disease burden and infection risk when depending solely on clinical surveillance data.",

        "abstract": "Rotavirus is the leading cause of dehydrating diarrhea among children in developing countries. The impact of rotaviral diarrhea on nutritional status is not well understood. We aimed to determine the association between rotavirus-positive moderate-to-severe diarrhea and nutrition in children under 5 years of age. We analyzed data from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study on children 0-59 months old from South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The relationships between explanatory variables and outcome variables were assessed using multiple linear regression; the explanatory variable was the presence of rotavirus in the stool sample, and the outcome variables were z scores [length/height-for-age (LAZ/HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-length/height (WLZ/WHZ)] at follow-up (∼60 days). The prevalence of rotaviral diarrhea was 17.3% (905/5,219) in South Asia and 19.95% (842/4,220) in sub-Saharan Africa. Rotavirus was associated with higher LAZ/HAZ (β: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.26; P <0.001) and WAZ (β: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.22; P <0.001) in sub-Saharan Africa and with lower WLZ/WHZ (β coefficient: -0.08; 95% CI: -0.15, -0.009; P = 0.027) in South Asia. Our study indicates that rotaviral diarrhea is positively associated with nutritional status in sub-Saharan Africa and is negatively associated with nutritional status in South Asia. An expedited implementation policy of ongoing preventive and control strategies, including vaccination against rotavirus, is necessary to reduce the burden of rotaviral diarrhea, which may further help to reduce the potential nutritional ramifications.",

        "abstract": "<i>Vibrio cholerae</i> O1 causes the diarrheal disease cholera, and the small intestine is the site of active infection. During cholera, cholera toxin is secreted from <i>V. cholerae</i> and induces a massive fluid influx into the small intestine, which causes vomiting and diarrhea. Typically, <i>V. cholerae</i> genomes are sequenced from bacteria passed in stool, but rarely from vomit, a fluid that may more closely represents the site of active infection. We hypothesized that the <i>V. cholerae</i> O1 population bottlenecks along the gastrointestinal tract would result in reduced genetic variation in stool compared to vomit. To test this, we sequenced <i>V. cholerae</i> genomes from ten cholera patients with paired vomit and stool samples. Genetic diversity was low in both vomit and stool, consistent with a single infecting population rather than co-infection with divergent <i>V. cholerae</i> O1 lineages. The number of single nucleotide variants decreased between vomit and stool in four patients, increased in two, and remained unchanged in four. The number of genes encoded in the <i>V. cholerae</i> genome decreased between vomit and stool in eight patients and increased in two. Pangenome analysis of assembled short-read sequencing demonstrated that the toxin-coregulated pilus operon more frequently contained deletions in genomes from vomit compared to stool. However, these deletions were not detected by PCR or long-read sequencing, indicating that interpreting gene presence or absence patterns from short-read data alone may be incomplete. Overall, we found that <i>V. cholerae</i> O1 isolated from stool is genetically similar to <i>V. cholerae</i> recovered from the upper intestinal tract.",

M&E of surveillance programs were identified among which PHE due to COVID-19 was most prevalent. M&E was conducted in response to COVID-19, cholera, Nipah, Ebola, <i>Candida auris</i>, and hepatitis A. OR practice was minimal and reported from India and Indonesia. India conducted OR on COVID-19 and malaria, whereas Indonesia focused on COVID-19 and influenza. While most SEAR countries have mechanisms for conducting M&E, there is a noticeable limitation in OR practices. There is a compelling need to develop a standard framework for M&E. Additionally, enhancing private sector engagement is crucial for strengthening preparedness against PHE.

        "abstract": "Both individually and cluster randomized study designs have been used for vaccine trials to assess the effects of vaccine on reducing the risk of disease or infection. The choice between individually and cluster randomized designs is often driven by the target estimand of interest (eg, direct versus total), statistical power, and, importantly, logistic feasibility. To combat emerging infectious disease threats, especially when the number of events from one single trial may not be adequate to obtain vaccine effect estimates with a desired level of precision, it may be necessary to combine information across multiple trials. In this article, we propose a model formulation to estimate the direct, indirect, total, and overall vaccine effects combining data from trials with two types of study designs: individual-randomization and cluster-randomization, based on a Cox proportional hazards model, where the hazard of infection depends on both vaccine status of the individual as well as the vaccine status of the other individuals in the same cluster. We illustrate the use of the proposed model and assess the potential efficiency gain from combining data from multiple trials, compared to using data from each individual trial alone, through two simulation studies, one of which is designed based on a cholera vaccine trial previously carried out in Matlab, Bangladesh.",

This study assessed the probiotic efficacy and safety of LAB strains isolated from Laban, a traditional fermented milk product. Seven primarily selected Gram-positive, catalase-negative, non-spore-forming isolates were examined for their antimicrobial activity against the bacterial pathogens Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio cholera, and the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Two isolates, identified as Pediococcus pentosaceus L1 and Streptococcus thermophilus L3, which showed antimicrobial activity against all pathogens, were further evaluated for their probiotic competence. The selected isolates demonstrated strong resistance to low pH, bile salts, and phenol, indicating their potential for gastric endurance. They also exhibited high cell surface hydrophobicity to various hydrocarbons, autoaggregation, and coaggregation properties, demonstrating strong adhesion abilities. In addition, both isolates showed strong antioxidant activity and were non-hemolytic. Although the isolates had some resistance to certain antibiotics, they were generally susceptible to commonly used antibiotics. The two LAB strains also exhibited promising technological properties, such as milk coagulation and exopolysaccharide production, indicating their potential to enhance the quality of dairy products. The results suggest that the LAB strains isolated from Laban have strong potential as probiotics, and due to their food origin, they are highly likely to exhibit maximal efficacy in food and pharmaceutical products for human consumption.",

        "abstract": "Oral cholera vaccine (OCV) and incremental improvements in household water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) within cholera-endemic areas can reduce cholera risk. However, we lack empiric evaluation of their combined impact. We evaluated a cluster-randomized, placebo-controlled trial of OCV (Shanchol) in Kolkata, India. The study population included 108 777 individuals, and 106 879 nonpregnant individuals >1 year of age were eligible to receive 2 doses of OCV or placebo. We measured cholera risk in all household members assigned to OCV vs placebo and in all members of households with \"Better\" vs \"Not Better\" WASH, where WASH was classified according to validated criteria. Protection was measured by Cox proportional hazard models. Residence in an OCV household was associated with protective effectiveness (PE) of 54% (95% CI, 42%-64%; <i>P</i> < .001) and was similar regardless of Better (PE, 57%; 95% CI, 26%-75%; <i>P</i> = .002) or Not Better (PE, 53%; 95% CI, 40%-64%; <i>P</i> < .001) household WASH. Better WASH household residence was associated with PE of 30% (95% CI, 5%-48%; <i>P</i> = .023) and was similar in OCV (PE, 24%; 95% CI, -26% to 54%; <i>P</i> = .293) and placebo (PE, 29%; 95% CI, -3% to 51%; <i>P</i> = .069) households. When assessed conjointly, residence in OCV households with Better WASH was associated with the greatest PE against cholera at 69% (95% CI, 49%-81%; <i>P</i> < .001). These findings suggest that the combination of a vaccine policy and improved WASH reduces cholera risk more than either would alone, although the magnitude of either intervention was not affected by the other. Future randomized trials investigating OCV and WASH interventions separately and together are recommended to further understand the interaction between OCV and WASH.",

Results revealed that the per capita health expenditure and the number of doctors showed a significant positive impact on life expectancy and maternal and child health. Also, the government's annual budget on the health sector and number of doctors had a significant positive impact on lowering deaths by Diphtheria, Cholera, Tuberculosis, and Malaria diseases.

We considered any available WHO-prequalified oral killed cholera vaccine as an intervention. The control group was given a placebo, another vaccine, or no vaccine. The outcomes were related to vaccine effectiveness and safety. We included articles published in English only. Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and extracted data from included studies. We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane ROB 1 assessment tool. We used the generic inverse variance and a random-effects model meta-analysis to estimate the pooled effect of the interventions. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. For vaccine effectiveness (VE), we converted the overall risk ratio (RR) to vaccine effectiveness using the formula: VE = (1 - RR) x 100%. Five RCTs, reported in 12 records, with 462,754 participants, met the inclusion criteria. We identified trials on whole-cell plus recombinant vaccine (WC-rBS vaccine (Dukoral)) from Peru and trials on bivalent whole-cell vaccine (BivWC (Shanchol)) vaccine from India and Bangladesh. We did not identify any trials on other BivWC vaccines (Euvichol/Euvichol-Plus), or Hillchol. Two doses of Dukoral with or without a booster dose reduces cases of cholera at two-year follow-up in a general population of children and adults, and at five-month follow-up in an adult male population (overall VE 76%; RR 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.65; 2 trials, 16,423 participants; high-certainty evidence). Two doses of Shanchol reduces cases of cholera at one-year follow-up (overall VE 37%; RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.85; 2 trials, 241,631 participants; high-certainty evidence), at two-year follow-up (overall VE 64%; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.81; 2 trials, 168,540 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and at five-year follow-up (overall VE 80%; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.26; 1 trial, 54,519 participants; high-certainty evidence). A single dose of Shanchol reduces cases of cholera at six-month follow-up (overall VE 40%; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.77; 1 trial, 204,700 participants; high-certainty evidence), and at two-year follow-up (overall VE 39%; RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.70; 1 trial, 204,700 participants; high-certainty evidence). A single dose of Shanchol also reduces cases of severe dehydrating cholera at six-month follow-up (overall VE 63%; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.50; 1 trial, 204,700 participants; high-certainty evidence), and at two-year follow-up (overall VE 50%; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.60; 1 trial, 204,700 participants; high-certainty evidence). We found no differences in the reporting of adverse events due to vaccination between the vaccine and control/placebo groups. Two doses of Dukoral reduces cases of cholera at two-year follow-up. Two doses of Shanchol reduces cases of cholera at five-year follow-up, and a single dose of Shanchol reduces cases of cholera at two-year follow-up. Overall, the vaccines were safe and well-tolerated. We found no trials on other BivWC vaccines (Euvichol/Euvichol-Plus). However, BivWC products (Shanchol, Euvichol/Euvichol-Plus) are considered to produce comparable vibriocidal responses. Therefore, it is reasonable to apply the results from Shanchol trials to the other BivWC products (Euvichol/Euvichol-Plus).",

One inactivated OCV (with tradenames Shanchol™ and Euvichol-Plus™) is used in the stockpile, but the number of available doses is inadequate to meet the rapidly rising demand for OCVs from countries affected by cholera. Newer, simplified inactivated OCVs under development offer the possibilities of lower expense and higher production yields, and could expand the stockpile. However, their clinical development is made complex because placebo-controlled randomised trials of OCV efficacy are no longer ethically permissible and because the serum vibriocidal antibodies used to measure OCV responses are not correlates of OCV protection against cholera. Here, we propose an observational study design with features to enhance methodological rigor to provide credible evidence of protection against cholera by these newer vaccines.",

The disease transmits mainly via drinking water carrying Vibrio cholerae; and household contacts (HHC) of cholera patients are at elevated risk during the first week of infection. The gut microbiota profiles of HHC-children of cholera patients at Dhaka city slums were investigated before (day 0) and after (day 8) delivery of chlorinated water as part of the major study 'CHoBI7 trial (cholera-hospital-based intervention for 7 days)'. Results of sequencing and analysis of bacterial community DNA revealed the predominance of two bacterial phyla: Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes at day 0 with a relative abundance of 62 ± 6 (mean ± SEM%) and 32 ± 7, respectively. The pattern reversed at day 8 with a decreased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (39 ± 12; p = 0.034) and an increased abundance of Firmicutes (49 ± 12; p = 0.057). Of 65 bacterial families confirmed at day 0, six belonging to Proteobacteria including Vibrionaceae disappeared at day 8. Interestingly, the relative abundance of four Firmicutes families-Lachnospiraceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Ruminococcaceae was increased in all five study children at day 8. The observed exclusion of pathogenic Proteobacteria and enhancement of beneficial Firmicutes in the gut of children delivered with chlorinated water as part of WASH intervention reflect a great promise of the CHoBI7 program in preventing cholera and improving child health.",

        "abstract": "The global nonprofit organization PATH hosted the third Vaccines Against Shigella and Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VASE) Conference in Washington, DC, on November 29 to December 1, 2022. With a combination of plenary sessions and posters, keynote presentations, and breakout workshops, the 2022 VASE Conference featured key updates on research related to the development of vaccines against neglected diarrheal pathogens including Shigella, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Campylobacter, and Salmonella. The presentations and discussions highlighted the significant impact of these diarrheal pathogens, particularly on the health of infants and young children in low- and middle-income countries, reflecting the urgent need for the development and licensure of new enteric vaccines. Oral and poster presentations at the VASE Conference explored a range of topics, including: the global burden and clinical presentation of disease, epidemiology, and the impact of interventions; the assessment of the value of vaccines against enteric pathogens; preclinical evaluations of vaccine candidates and models of enteric diseases; vaccine candidates in clinical trials and human challenge models; host parameters and genomics that predict responses to infection and disease; the application of new omics technologies for characterization of emerging pathogens and host responses; novel adjuvants, vaccine delivery platforms, and immunization strategies; and strategies for combination/co-administered vaccines. The conference agenda also featured ten breakout workshop sessions on topics of importance to the enteric vaccine field, which are summarized separately. This article reviews key points and highlighted research presented in each of the plenary conference sessions and poster presentations at the 2022 VASE Conference.",

        "abstract": "Global cholera control efforts rely heavily on effective water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions in cholera-endemic settings. Using data from a large, randomized controlled trial of oral cholera vaccine conducted in Kolkata, India, we evaluated whether natural variations in WASH in an urban slum setting were predictive of cholera risk. From the control population (n = 55 086), baseline WASH data from a randomly selected \"training subpopulation\" (n = 27 634) were analyzed with recursive partitioning to develop a dichotomous (\"better\" vs \"not better\") composite household WASH variable from several WASH features collected at baseline, and this composite variable was then evaluated in a mutually exclusive \"validation population\" (n = 27 452). We then evaluated whether residents of better WASH households in the entire population (n = 55 086) experienced lower cholera risk using Cox regression models. Better WASH was defined by a combination of 4 dichotomized WASH characteristics including safe source of water for daily use, safe source of drinking water, private or shared flush toilet use, and always handwashing with soap after defecation. Residence in better WASH households was associated with a 30% reduction in risk of cholera over a 5-year period (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70 [95% confidence interval, .49-.99]; <i>P</i> = .048). We also found that the impact of better WASH households on reducing cholera risk was greatest in young children (0-4 years) and this effect progressively declined with age. The evidence suggests that modest improvements in WASH facilities and behaviors significantly modify cholera risk and may be an important component of cholera prevention and elimination strategies in endemic settings. <b>Clinical Trials Registration.</b> NCT00289224.",

(1) Background: Enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> infection is a main cause of diarrheal disease in endemic countries. The characterization of the immune responses evoked by natural infection can guide vaccine development efforts. (2) Methods: A total of 617 adult and 480 pediatric diarrheal patients were screened, and 43 adults and 46 children (below 5 years of age) with an acute ETEC infection completed the study. The plasma samples were analyzed for antibody responses against the ETEC toxins. (3) Results: Heat-stable toxin (ST)-positive ETEC is the main cause of ETEC infection in adults, unlike in children in an endemic setting. We detected very low levels of anti-ST antibodies, and no ST-neutralizing activity. However, infection with ETEC strains expressing the heat-labile toxin (LT) induced systemic antibody responses in less than 25% of subjects. The antibody levels against LTA and LTB, as well as cholera toxin (CT), correlated well. The anti-LT antibodies were shown to have LT- and CT- neutralizing activity. The antibody reactivity against linear LT epitopes did not correlate with toxin-neutralizing activity. (4) Conclusions: Unlike LT, ST is a poor antigen and even adults have low anti-ST antibody levels that do not allow for the detection of toxin-neutralizing activity.",

        "abstract": "Screening for G6PD deficiency can inform disease management including malaria. Treatment with the antimalarial drugs primaquine and tafenoquine can be guided by point-of-care testing for G6PD deficiency. Data from similar clinical studies evaluating the performance of the STANDARD G6PD Test (SD Biosensor, South Korea) conducted in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States were pooled. Test performance was assessed in a retrospective analysis on capillary and venous specimens. All study sites used spectrophotometry for reference G6PD testing, and either the HemoCue or complete blood count for reference hemoglobin measurement. The sensitivity of the STANDARD G6PD Test using the manufacturer thresholds for G6PD deficient and intermediate cases in capillary specimens from 4212 study participants was 100% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 97.5%-100%) for G6PD deficient cases with <30% activity and 77% (95% CI 66.8%-85.4%) for females with intermediate activity between 30%-70%. Specificity was 98.1% (95% CI 97.6%-98.5%) and 92.8% (95% CI 91.6%-93.9%) for G6PD deficient individuals and intermediate females, respectively. Out of 20 G6PD intermediate females with false normal results, 12 had activity levels >60% on the reference assay. The negative predictive value for females with G6PD activity >60% was 99.6% (95% CI 99.1%-99.8%) on capillary specimens. Sensitivity among 396 P. vivax malaria cases was 100% (69.2%-100.0%) for both deficient and intermediate cases. Across the full dataset, 37% of those classified as G6PD deficient or intermediate resulted from true normal cases. Despite this, over 95% of cases would receive correct treatment with primaquine, over 87% of cases would receive correct treatment with tafenoquine, and no true G6PD deficient cases would be treated inappropriately based on the result of the STANDARD G6PD Test. The STANDARD G6PD Test enables safe access to drugs which are contraindicated for individuals with G6PD deficiency. Operational considerations will inform test uptake in specific settings.",

Our study quantified the association between intestinal protozoan parasites and child anthropometric outcomes among children under-5. We analyzed data from 7,800 children enrolled in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) across seven study sites that were positive for intestinal protozoan parasites between December 2007 and March 2011. Parasites were assessed using stool immunoassays (ELISA). We applied multiple linear regression to test the association between any or concurrent parasite and child anthropometric outcomes: length/height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-length/height (WHZ) z-score after 60 days of enrollment. Models were stratified by diarrheal symptoms, driven by the study design, and adjusted for potential covariates. During the follow-up at day 60 after enrollment, child anthropometric outcomes, among the asymptomatic children showed, negative associations between Giardia with HAZ [β: -0.13; 95% CI: -0.17, -0.09; p<0.001] and WAZ [β -0.07; 95% CI: -0.11, -0.04; p<0.001], but not WHZ [β: -0.02; 95% CI:-0.06, 0.02; p = 0.36]; Cryptosporidium with WAZ [β: -0.15; 95% CI: -0.22, -0.09; p<0.001] and WHZ [β: -0.18; 95%CI: -0.25, -0.12; p<0.001], but not with HAZ [β: -0.03; 95% CI: -0.09, 0.04; p = 0.40]. For symptomatic children, no associations were found between Giardia and anthropometry; negative associations were found between Cryptosporidium with HAZ [β: -0.17; 95% CI: -0.23, -0.11; p<0.001], WAZ [β: -0.25; 95% CI: -0.31, -0.19; p<0.001] and WHZ [β: -0.23; 95% CI: -0.30, -0.17; p<0.001]. Among the asymptomatic 24-59 months children, Giardia had a negative association with HAZ [β: -0.09; 95% CI: -0.15, -0.04; p = 0.001]. No significant associations were found between E. histolytica with child growth. While some studies have found that Giardia is not associated with (or protective against) acute diarrhea, our findings suggest that it is associated with growth shortfall. This observation underscores the need for preventive strategies targeting enteric protozoan parasites among young children, to reduce the burden of childhood malnutrition.",

We took advantage of excess serum samples collected as part of the toxicological study and assessed the immunogenicity of CCV OSP:rTTHc in rabbits. We found that vaccination with CCV induced OSP-, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-, and rTTHc-specific immune responses in rabbits, that immune responses were functional as assessed by vibriocidal activity, and that immune responses were protective against death in an established virulent challenge assay. CCV OSP:rTTHc immunogenicity in two animal model systems (mice and rabbits) is encouraging and supports further development of this vaccine for evaluation in humans.",

        "title": "Estimating the proportion of clinically suspected cholera cases that are true Vibrio cholerae infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
        "abstract": "Cholera surveillance relies on clinical diagnosis of acute watery diarrhea. Suspected cholera case definitions have high sensitivity but low specificity, challenging our ability to characterize cholera burden and epidemiology. Our objective was to estimate the proportion of clinically suspected cholera that are true Vibrio cholerae infections and identify factors that explain variation in positivity. We conducted a systematic review of studies that tested ≥10 suspected cholera cases for V. cholerae O1/O139 using culture, PCR, and/or a rapid diagnostic test. We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar for studies that sampled at least one suspected case between January 1, 2000 and April 19, 2023, to reflect contemporary patterns in V. cholerae positivity. We estimated diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity using a latent class meta-analysis. We estimated V. cholerae positivity using a random-effects meta-analysis, adjusting for test performance. We included 119 studies from 30 countries. V. cholerae positivity was lower in studies with representative sampling and in studies that set minimum ages in suspected case definitions. After adjusting for test performance, on average, 52% (95% credible interval (CrI): 24%, 80%) of suspected cases represented true V. cholerae infections. After adjusting for test performance and study methodology, the odds of a suspected case having a true infection were 5.71 (odds ratio 95% CrI: 1.53, 15.43) times higher when surveillance was initiated in response to an outbreak than in non-outbreak settings. Variation across studies was high, and a limitation of our approach was that we were unable to explain all the heterogeneity with study-level attributes, including diagnostic test used, setting, and case definitions. In this study, we found that burden estimates based on suspected cases alone may overestimate the incidence of medically attended cholera by 2-fold. However, accounting for cases missed by traditional clinical surveillance is key to unbiased cholera burden estimates. Given the substantial variability in positivity between settings, extrapolations from suspected to confirmed cases, which is necessary to estimate cholera incidence rates without exhaustive testing, should be based on local data.",

        "abstract": "The Global Typhoid Genomics Consortium was established to bring together the typhoid research community to aggregate and analyse <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhi (Typhi) genomic data to inform public health action. This analysis, which marks 22 years since the publication of the first Typhi genome, represents the largest Typhi genome sequence collection to date (n=13,000). This is a meta-analysis of global genotype and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants extracted from previously sequenced genome data and analysed using consistent methods implemented in open analysis platforms GenoTyphi and Pathogenwatch. Compared with previous global snapshots, the data highlight that genotype 4.3.1 (H58) has not spread beyond Asia and Eastern/Southern Africa; in other regions, distinct genotypes dominate and have independently evolved AMR. Data gaps remain in many parts of the world, and we show the potential of travel-associated sequences to provide informal 'sentinel' surveillance for such locations. The data indicate that ciprofloxacin non-susceptibility (>1 resistance determinant) is widespread across geographies and genotypes, with high-level ciprofloxacin resistance (≥3 determinants) reaching 20% prevalence in South Asia. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid has become dominant in Pakistan (70% in 2020) but has not yet become established elsewhere. Ceftriaxone resistance has emerged in eight non-XDR genotypes, including a ciprofloxacin-resistant lineage (4.3.1.2.1) in India. Azithromycin resistance mutations were detected at low prevalence in South Asia, including in two common ciprofloxacin-resistant genotypes. The consortium's aim is to encourage continued data sharing and collaboration to monitor the emergence and global spread of AMR Typhi, and to inform decision-making around the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) and other prevention and control strategies. No specific funding was awarded for this meta-analysis.

        "abstract": "The underdeveloped countries with large populations are facing a grave global threat in the form of cholera. <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, the etiologic agent of Cholera has drawn attention recently due to antimicrobial resistance and resulting outbreaks that necessitates establishment of novel medications to counteract virulence and viability of the pathogen. <i>Sterculia urens</i> Roxb. (Malvaceae) is an ethnomedicinally important tree, which harbors a good number of bioactive phytocompounds. In the present study, 53 phytocompounds of <i>S. urens</i> were screened against the promising target ToxT of <i>V. cholerae</i> employing structure-based drug design approach that revealed three lead compounds, viz., 4,4,5,8-Tetramethylchroman-2-ol (-8.2 kcal/mol), Beta-Bisabolol (-8.2 kcal/mol) and Ledol (-8.7 kcal/mol) with satisfactory ADMET properties. Molecular dynamics simulation for 150 ns unveiled notable compactness and structural stability for the lead compounds considering RMSD, RMSF, Rg, MolSA, PSA and protein-ligand contacts parameters. Molecular mechanics-based MM/GBSA binding energy calculation revealed Beta-Bisabolol (-66.74 kcal/mol) to have better scores than 4,4,5,8-Tetramethylchroman-2-ol (-47.42 kcal/mol) and Ledol (-65.79 kcal/mol). Enzymes were mostly found as drug target class, and Nabilone was found as a structurally similar analog for 4,4,5,8-Tetramethylchroman-2-ol. These discoveries could aid in revealing new antibacterial medications targeting ToxT to combat Cholera.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

        "abstract": "Cholera caused by <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> O139 emerged in the early 1990s and spread rapidly to 11 Asian countries before receding for unclear reasons. Protection against cholera is serogroup-specific, which is defined by the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) component of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). <i>V. cholerae</i> O139 also expresses the OSP-capsule. We, therefore, assessed antibody responses targeting <i>V. cholerae</i> O139 OSP, LPS, capsule, and vibriocidal responses in patients in Bangladesh with cholera caused by <i>V. cholerae</i> O139. We compared these responses to those of age-gender-blood group-matched recipients of the bivalent oral cholera vaccine (OCV O1/O139). We found prominent OSP, LPS, and vibriocidal responses in patients, with a high correlation between these responses. OSP responses primarily targeted the terminal tetrasaccharide of OSP. Vaccinees developed OSP, LPS, and vibriocidal antibody responses, but of significantly lower magnitude and responder frequency (RF) than matched patients. We separately analyzed responses in pediatric vaccinees born after <i>V. cholerae</i> O139 had receded in Bangladesh. We found that OSP responses were boosted in children who had previously received a single dose of bivalent OCV 3 yr previously but not in vaccinated immunologically naïve children. Our results suggest that OSP-specific responses occur during cholera caused by <i>V. cholerae</i> O139 despite the presence of capsules, that vaccination with bivalent OCV is poorly immunogenic in the short term in immunologically naïve individuals, but that OSP-specific immune responses can be primed by previous exposure, although whether such responses can protect against O139 cholera is uncertain. IMPORTANCE Cholera is a severe dehydrating illness in humans caused by <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> serogroups O1 or O139. Protection against cholera is serogroup-specific, which is defined by the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of <i>V. cholerae</i> LPS. Yet, little is known about immunity to O139 OSP. In this study, we assessed immune responses targeting OSP in patients from an endemic region with cholera caused by <i>V. cholerae</i> O139. We compared these responses to those of the age-gender-blood group-matched recipients of the bivalent oral cholera vaccine. Our results suggest that OSP-specific responses occur during cholera caused by <i>V. cholerae</i> O139 and that the OSP responses primarily target the terminal tetrasaccharide of OSP. Our results further suggest that vaccination with the bivalent vaccine is poorly immunogenic in the short term for inducing O139-specific OSP responses in immunologically naïve individuals, but OSP-specific immune responses can be primed by previous exposure or vaccination.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial and multidrug resistance (MDR) pathogens are becoming one of the major health threats among children. Integrated studies on the molecular epidemiology and prevalence of AMR and MDR diarrheal pathogens are lacking. A total of 404 fecal specimens were collected from children with diarrhea in Bangladesh from January 2019 to December 2021. We used conventional bacteriologic and molecular sequence analysis methods. Phenotypic and genotypic resistance were determined by disk diffusion and molecular sequencing methods. Fisher's exact tests with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was performed. Prevalence of bacterial infection was 63% (251 of 404) among children with diarrhea. E. coli (29%) was the most prevalent. E. coli, Shigella spp., V. cholerae, and Salmonella spp., showed the highest frequency of resistance against ceftriaxone (75-85%), and erythromycin (70-75%%). About 10-20% isolates of E. coli, V. cholerae and Shigella spp. showed MDR against cephem, macrolides, and quinolones. Significant association (p value < 0.05) was found between the phenotypic and genotypic resistance. The risk of diarrhea was the highest among the patients co-infected with E. coli and rotavirus [OR 3.6 (95% CI 1.1-5.4) (p = 0.001)] followed by Shigella spp. and rotavirus [OR 3.5 (95% CI 0.5-5.3) (p = 0.001)].

        "abstract": "Despite focusing on cholera burden, epidemiologic studies in Bangladesh tend to be limited in geographic scope. National-level cholera surveillance data can help inform cholera control strategies and assess the effectiveness of preventive measures. Hospital-based sentinel surveillance among patients with suspected diarrhea in different sites across Bangladesh has been conducted since 2014. We selected an age-stratified sample of 20 suspected cholera cases each week from each sentinel site, tested stool for the presence of Vibrio cholerae O1/O139 by culture, and characterized antibiotic susceptibility in a subset of culture-positive isolates. We estimated the odds of being culture positive among suspected cholera cases according to different potential risk factors. From May 4, 2014 through November 30, 2021, we enrolled 51,414 suspected cases from our sentinel surveillance sites. We confirmed V. cholerae O1 in 5.2% of suspected cases through microbiological culture. The highest proportion of confirmed cholera cases was from Chittagong (9.7%) and the lowest was from Rangpur Division (0.9%). Age, number of purges, duration of diarrhea, occupation, and season were the most relevant factors in distinguishing cholera-positive suspected cases from cholera-negative suspected cases. Nationwide surveillance data show that cholera is circulating in Bangladesh and the southern region is more affected than the northern region. Antimicrobial resistance patterns indicate that multidrug resistance (resistance to three or more classes of antibiotics) of V. cholerae O1 could be a major threat in the future. Alignment of these results with Bangladesh's cholera-control program will be the foundation for future research into the efficacy of cholera-control initiatives.",

Serologic surveillance provides a complementary approach to monitoring infections, though the link between serologically-derived infections and medically-attended disease - shaped by immunological, behavioral, and clinical factors - remains poorly understood. We unravel this cascade in a cholera-endemic Bangladeshi community by integrating clinic-based surveillance, healthcare seeking, and longitudinal serological data through statistical modeling. We found >50% of the study population had a <i>V. cholerae</i> O1 infection annually, and infection timing was not consistently correlated with reported cases. Four in 2,340 infections resulted in symptoms, only one of which was reported through the surveillance system.

        "abstract": "Cholera remains a significant public health concern in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene. Bangladesh and other impoverished nations have been severely affected by cholera outbreaks, especially in areas with a high population density. In order to mitigate the spread of cholera, oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) are recommended as a prophylactic measure. In May 2018, 775,666 of the Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMN) in the registered and makeshift camps and 103,605 of the residents in the host community received two doses of OCV Shanchol<sup>TM</sup> in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, because the conditions in the area favored the transmission of cholera and other waterborne diseases. This study aimed to assess the coverage of OCV among the FDMN and the host community in Cox's Bazar. In August 2018, we enrolled 4,240 respondents for this study following the \"World Health Organization (WHO) Vaccination Coverage Cluster Surveys: Reference Manual (2018).\" The coverage survey was conducted with three strata of the population: the host community from the Teknaf Upazila, the registered camp, and the makeshift camp from the Ukhia Upazila. We collected information regarding OCV coverage, demographic characteristics, and knowledge and behaviors of people toward the vaccine. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. According to our study, the overall OCV coverage was 85%, with 68% in the host community, 91% in the registered camp, and 98% in the makeshift camp. The lower coverage in the host community was due to residents unaware of the vaccination campaign, the unavailability of vaccines, and unaware where to go for vaccination. Our findings demonstrate that the OCV campaign in the FDMN camps was successful, reaching over 90% coverage, while coverage in the host community was much lower. In order to make sure that OCV vaccination efforts are reaching the target population and having the desired impact, our study emphasizes the need to inform the target population of when and where to get vaccinated.",

AntiBiotics for Children with severe Diarrhea was a 7-country, placebo-controlled, double-blind efficacy trial of azithromycin in children 2-23 months of age with watery diarrhea accompanied by dehydration or malnutrition. We tested fecal samples for enteric pathogens utilizing quantitative polymerase chain reaction to identify likely and possible bacterial etiologies and employed pathogen-specific cutoffs based on genomic target quantity in previous case-control diarrhea etiology studies to identify likely and possible bacterial etiologies. Among 6692 children, the leading likely etiologies were rotavirus (21.1%), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli encoding heat-stable toxin (13.3%), Shigella (12.6%), and Cryptosporidium (9.6%).

Our study showed that relying solely on <i>E. coli</i> detection as a measure of water quality may overlook the presence of other pathogens in the drinking water.

        "abstract": "Cholera is one of the most rapidly fatal infectious diseases known. Historically, two major problems have been faced by those who care for patients with cholera: first, how to treat individual patients to prevent rapid death, and second, how to prevent the spread of this highly contagious disease in the immediate community and beyond. In this review, we will discuss how clinical scientists have approached these two issues with some personal experiences that Dr William B Greenough III encountered when he was addressing these problems and treating cholera victims at the Pakistan SEATO Cholera Research Laboratory in the early 1960s in Dhaka, East Pakistan.",
