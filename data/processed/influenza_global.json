        "abstract": "Here, we report the case of a term neonate with late-onset Group B Streptococcal (GBS) bacteremia in whom the FilmArray® Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT, US) falsely detected <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Although the CSF showed mild pleocytosis and elevated protein, there were no clinical signs of bacterial meningitis. Confirmatory testing, including multiplex PCR targeting <i>H. influenzae</i> (siaT), GBS (cfb), and 16S rRNA, as well as CSF culture, yielded negative results. Repeat FilmArray testing under controlled conditions was also negative. A manufacturer's investigation revealed borderline amplification of only one of the <i>H. influenzae</i> targets, which was interpreted algorithmically as positive. This discordance highlights a key limitation of multiplex PCR panels: the lack of transparency in signal interpretation and threshold settings. The patient demonstrated no immunodeficiency and remained clinically stable during a 10-month follow-up. This case underscores the importance of confirmatory testing when panel results contradict the clinical picture and advocates for improved algorithmic clarity and inter-laboratory validation. Increased awareness of such diagnostic pitfalls is essential, particularly in neonatal settings where unnecessary antimicrobial interventions may pose additional risks.",

        "abstract": "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) constitute a major threat to human and animal health. Currently, M2 ion-channel inhibitors, neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, and cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors have been applied clinically as therapeutics against IAVs. However, IAVs possess adaptive mutations to these inhibitors, especially M2 ion channel and NA inhibitors. Thus, novel antiviral agents should be developed. In the present study, we screen approximately 5500 compounds and identify an IAV inhibitor, nanchangmycin, which possesses a robust antiviral activity both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In addition, it exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity for additional virus infections, including pseudorabies virus, herpes virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. Most importantly, it has antiviral activity against oseltamivir-resistant strains in sub-μM ranges and promotes the survival of MDCK cells infected with the oseltamivir-resistant influenza A virus strain. Further studies reveal that it blocks the nuclei migration of viral nuclear proteins (NPs), resulting in NP accumulation in the cytoplasm, particularly within perinuclear endosomes. Also, it inhibits IAVs by blocking endosomal acidification. Overall, nanchangmycin has the potential to be developed as an anti-influenza agent.",

        "abstract": "Yeast beta-glucans demonstrate immune-modulating effects; however, few studies have explored the potential of yeast beta-glucans to enhance immune response to vaccination. This pilot study aimed to assess the adjuvant effect of a yeast beta-glucan supplementation on antibody titer response to influenza vaccination. Adults (<i>n</i> = 90; 70.7 ± 10.1 years) were recruited over two vaccination seasons and randomized to receive 500 mg of beta-glucan or placebo (500 mg cellulose) daily in a double-blind study design. Pre- and 4 wk post-vaccination serum influenza-specific antibody titers were assessed using an optimized Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assay. Plasma cytokines 24 h post-vaccination were quantified by immunoassay. Cold and flu symptoms, using the Modified Jackson Criteria, fever, and self-perceived fatigue were monitored daily. Linear mixed models were used to test for differences in the fixed effects of time, treatment, and their interactions. In season 1 (Fall 2022), despite a baseline suggesting seroprotection for the Influenza A (H3N2 A/Wisconsin/67/2005) in 92% of the beta-glucan group and 74% of the placebo group, the post-vaccination antibody titer response (Δ = 95.8) favored beta-glucan over placebo (<i>p</i> = 0.037). Influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 antigen demonstrated poor detection; 7 of the 10 HI detectible antibody responses seen were in the beta-glucan group. In season 2 (Fall 2023), the Influenza A (H1N1 A/Victoria/4897/2022) antigen demonstrated poor detection (14%), which precluded further cohort analyses. Of the cytokines, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) increased similarly in both groups after vaccination, not supporting the adjuvant action of beta-glucan at the cellular level. Reported cold and flu symptoms were low in both groups and did not differ. Overall, the findings suggest that yeast beta-glucan supplementation may elicit a greater change in antibody titer to seasonal influenza vaccination. However, confirmation is needed with a larger sample of older adults and with follow-up to assess protection from disease.

        "abstract": "Alterations in the gut microbiom can significantly impact various regions in the human body, including the pulmonary tract. This study investigates alterations in the gut microbiome during a high-fat diet (HFD), particularly short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and how these metabolites affect lung infection caused by Influenza A virus (IAV). We used a HFD-mouse model to evaluate gut microbiota composition, SCFA levels, and pulmonary outcomes following IAV infection. Microbial changes were analyzed via taxonomic and functional profiling and SCFA levels were measured from non-obese and obese serum donors. Ultimately, acetate's effects were tested ex vivo in human precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) and in vitro in pulmonary epithelial cells. Mechanistic studies investigated the involvement of the SCFA receptor free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) and intracellular antiviral pathways. Our data indicates an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio of the gut microbiome and an altered carbohydrate metabolism, leading to reduced SCFA production. Infected HFD mice showed increased IAV titers and sustained microbial alterations. Interestingly, acetate demonstrated antiviral effects in both the human PCLS model and pulmonary cells with an reduced viral replication. These effects depended on FFAR2, which also acts as an IAV co-receptor, as acetate treatment led to FFAR2 internalization and influenced host cell metabolism in our in vitro data. HFD alters the SCFA production, reducing acetate levels in the gut microbiome. This reduction may lead to higher viral loads and worsened disease in HFD mice infected with IAV. Our findings indicate that acetate has antiviral effects during IAV infection in both a human ex vivo lung model and pulmonary epithelial cells. Here, acetate prevents viral entry and affects the cellular metabolic state and antiviral response. Understanding these mechanisms could provide new targets for preventing and treating viral infections in individuals with diet-related health issues.",

        "abstract": "To analyse the epidemiological characteristics of bacterial lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in hospitalized children aged 0-14 years in Hanzhong Central Hospital, China, and to provide evidence for empirical treatment and infection control. A retrospective analysis was conducted on bacterial detection (excluding Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae), seasonal variation, gender distribution, and age distribution among RTI paediatric patients admitted to Hanzhong Central Hospital from January 2023 to July 2024. Among 5,463 respiratory specimens from children clinically diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infections, 2093 bacterial strains were isolated, yielding a culture positivity rate of 38.30%. A total of 3413 specimens (62.88%) exhibited mixed growth of normal respiratory flora and were classified as culture-negative for pathogenic bacteria, based on standard microbiological criteria. The identified bacterial pathogens included Haemophilus influenzae (a recognized common cause of respiratory tract infections), as well as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli, which are typically associated with more severe or hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infections rather than community-acquired cases. Bacterial infections showed seasonal variation, being more prevalent in spring (first quarter) and summer (second quarter), with variations in dominant bacterial strains across different quarters. The infection rate in male children was higher than in females in all quarters, with statistically significant differences observed particularly in the infection rates of Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Children aged 0-3 years were the highest risk group for Staphylococcus aureus infection (11.61%), while the detection rates of various pathogens declined with increasing age. Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae were identified as the predominant pathogens responsible for paediatric respiratory infections in Hanzhong, exhibiting peak prevalence during spring and summer and the greatest burden among children under 3 years of age. The marked male predominance and age-specific pathogen distribution patterns highlight the necessity for seasonal surveillance, age-tailored empiric treatment strategies, and strengthened infection control measures in childcare environments. These findings offer evidence-based insights to inform clinical management and public health interventions in northwest China. Both family caregivers and healthcare providers should remain vigilant to these epidemiological characteristics in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.",

Social media is key in spreading vaccine information and it has opposite effects on vaccine hesitancy, alongside several socio-demographic and professional characteristics. This study aims to identify the characteristics of vaccine hesitancy among nurses and nursing students. A multi-centre, cross-sectional study was conducted between March and September 2023. Data were collected through an online survey to assess: (I) sociodemographic and occupational characteristics, and social media usage; (II) vaccine hesitancy (measured with the Vaccination Attitudes Examination Scale); (III) social media addiction (using the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale). K-means cluster analysis was performed to identify vaccine hesitancy profiles. ANOVA and Chi-square were adopted to identify the key characteristics of the profiles. Among 604 participants, three profiles were identified. Concerns about unforeseen future effects was the most relevant factor of vaccine hesitancy across all profiles for both COVID-19 and Influenza vaccines. The most hesitant profile included mainly older nurses. Influenza vaccination uptake was the highest in the least hesitant profile, which also reported greater use of social media platforms like YouTube, LinkedIn, and Twitter/X. This study provides insights to develop targeted interventions appropriate to nurses and nursing students' profiles. These results will support tailored vaccination campaigns to address the most relevant factors of vaccine hesitancy and provide evidence-based information to mitigate misconceptions and enhance vaccine uptake among nurses and nursing students.",

        "abstract": "Evodia lepta Merr. (ELM), a traditional medicinal herb widely used in southern China and Southeast Asia, has been historically applied for the treatment of febrile illnesses and flu-like symptoms. Previous studies have reported its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, but its efficacy against influenza virus infection remains largely unexplored. To evaluate the anti-influenza activity of the aqueous extract of ELM and elucidate its underlying mechanisms, particularly the role of HSP90/NF-κB signaling axis. The chemical constituents of ELM were characterized using UPLC-MS. A murine model of H1N1 influenza infection was established to assess the protective efficacy of ELM. Disease progression was evaluated through clinical symptoms, survival, histopathology, and inflammatory cytokine levels. Viral load and protein expression were assessed via RT-qPCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Network pharmacology was used to identify candidate targets, which were validated in vivo. The role of HSP90 was further confirmed using a selective inhibitor (AUY922). A combination study with oseltamivir evaluated potential synergistic effects. Ten major bioactive compounds were identified in ELM. Oral administration of ELM significantly improved body weight recovery, reduced morbidity and mortality, and alleviated lung pathology in H1N1-infected mice. ELM markedly decreased viral replication and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Mechanistic investigations revealed that ELM suppressed the expression of HSP90, a host chaperone essential for influenza virus polymerase function. Combination therapy with oseltamivir demonstrated enhanced antiviral efficacy, indicating a synergistic effect. ELM exerts significant therapeutic effects against influenza virus infection in vivo, likely through inhibition of HSP90/NF-κB signaling axis. These findings support the potential of ELM as a novel antiviral agent or adjunct therapy for the treatment of influenza.",

This article aims to explore the changes in respiratory pathogens among children with respiratory infections during the COVID-19 pandemic and after the comprehensive lifting of restrictions, providing a basis for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of pediatric respiratory infections in the post-pandemic era. We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed the targeted sequencing results of multiple respiratory pathogens in children with respiratory infections treated at the Children's Hospital affiliated with Shandong University from January 2022 to December 2023. A total of 16,571 targeted sequencing results of pathogens from children with respiratory infections were included in the analysis (2,810 cases in 2022 and 13,761 cases in 2023). The overall positive detection rates of pathogens in 2022 and 2023 were 95.19% and 96.56%, respectively. The positive detection rates for single pathogens were 16.01% vs. 19.29%, while the rates for two or more pathogens were 79.18% vs. 77.27%. The top three viral pathogens with the highest positive detection rates in both 2022 and 2023 were Rhinovirus (RV), Parainfluenza Virus (PIV), and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). In 2023, the top three bacterial pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, whereas in 2022, they were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bordetella pertussis. The positive detection rates of Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), RSV, Adenovirus (AdV), Influenza A Virus (IAV), and RV in 2023 were significantly higher than those in 2022 (all P < 0.05). However, the positive detection rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, and PIV were significantly lower in 2023 than in 2022 (all P < 0.001).

While the evidence on hMPV epidemiology is growing, the hMPV burden in adults has not been synthesised. We conducted a critical review of published evidence on the burden of hMPV in older adults and adults with comorbidities. Articles reporting the burden of hMPV disease in adults ⩾50 years or ⩾18 years with comorbidities in developed countries were searched in Embase and MEDLINE (1/January/2000-12/June/2023) databases. Observational and interventional studies on community-based or medically attended populations were included. Outcomes of interest encompassed prevalence, incidence, clinical presentation, severe outcomes and complications, healthcare utilisation, coinfection with respiratory syncytial virus or influenza, and child-to-adult transmission. We assessed the risk of bias, performed a qualitative and quantitative synthesis, and calculated pooled estimates using random-effects meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42023439068). In total, 119 of 2847 articles met the inclusion criteria, covering 663,361 patients. hMPV accounted for 3.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.7-4.2%, I<sup>2</sup> = 66%) of annual and 4.0% (95% CI 2.9-5.3%, I<sup>2</sup> = 78%) of seasonal symptomatic respiratory infections in older adults and 4.3% (95% CI 3.2-5.7%, I<sup>2</sup> = 66%, annual) and 5.1% (95% CI 3.2-7.9%, I<sup>2</sup> = 82%, seasonal) in high-risk adults. For high-risk adults, the estimated proportion of hMPV cases requiring hospitalisation was 51.4% (95% CI 33.2-69.3%, I<sup>2</sup> = 46%). Among medically attended cases, the proportions admitted to the intensive care unit and those resulting in mortality were 6.6% (95% CI 4.8-9.1%, I<sup>2</sup> = 34%) and 9.3% (95% CI 4.6-18%, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), respectively. hMPV burden is substantial in the adult population, particularly among those with underlying diseases.

        "abstract": "Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) viruses, particularly H5N1 and H7N9, have long been considered potential pandemic threats, despite the absence of sustained human-to-human transmission. However, recent outbreaks in previously unaffected regions, such as Antarctica, suggest we may be shifting from theoretical risk to a more imminent threat. These viruses are no longer limited to avian populations. Their increasing appearance in mammals, including dairy cattle and domestic animals, raises the likelihood of viral reassortment and mutations that could trigger a human pandemic. If such a scenario unfolds, the world may face a crisis marked by high transmissibility and lethality, without effective vaccines readily available. Unlike the COVID-19 pandemic, when vaccines were rapidly developed despite inequities in access, the current influenza vaccine production model, largely reliant on slow, egg-based technologies, is insufficient for a fast-moving outbreak. While newer platforms show promise, they remain in early stages and cannot yet meet global demand, which alerts to the urgent need for accelerating vaccine and drug development, especially universal vaccines, next-generation vaccine platforms designed to provide broad, long-lasting protection against a wide spectrum of HPAI virus subtypes and strains. Here we propose a paradigmatic shift toward a more integrated, digitalized One Health surveillance system that links human, animal, and environmental data, especially in high-risk spillover regions. We underscore that Artificial Intelligence can revolutionize pandemic preparedness strategies, from improving early detection to speeding up vaccine and drug development and access to medical care, but should not be considered a stand-alone solution.",

Understanding the mechanisms that disrupt the quiescence of dormant disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) is crucial for addressing metastatic progression.

Here we demonstrate, in mice, that influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to loss of the pro-dormancy phenotype in breast DCCs in the lung, causing DCC proliferation within days of infection and a massive expansion of carcinoma cells into metastatic lesions within two weeks. These phenotypic transitions and expansions are interleukin-6 dependent. We show that DCCs impair lung T cell activation and that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells sustain the pulmonary metastatic burden after the influenza infection by inhibiting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and cytotoxicity. Crucially, these experimental findings align with human observational data. Analyses of cancer survivors from the UK Biobank (all cancers) and Flatiron Health (breast cancer) databases reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increases the risk of cancer-related mortality and lung metastasis compared with uninfected cancer survivors.

        "abstract": "Chronic infection and inflammation of the lungs contribute significantly to disease progression in persons with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). Treatment regimens are largely based on isolating the putative causative pathogen(s) from respiratory samples using basic culturing methods. While this strategy has shown to be highly valuable in the management of CF, the approach is time-consuming and often misses detection of pathogenic microbes that are more difficult to culture, including Mycobacterium spp. In our proof-of-concept study, we evaluated shallow metagenomic shotgun sequencing to detect potential infection-causing pathogens at species level in sputum, oropharyngeal and salivary samples of pwCF (n = 13), and compared it to culture results from the clinic and standard 16S rRNA V4 amplicon sequencing. Shallow shotgun sequencing improved the detection of pathogenic species in respiratory samples compared to culture methods. In particular, shallow shotgun sequencing could detect pathogenic species associated with CF, specifically Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Haemophilus influenzae and Mycobacterium spp. in sputum, oropharyngeal and/or salivary samples. Notably, Mycobacterium spp. was not detected based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Moreover, our approach was able to distinguish S. aureus from S. epidermidis and H. influenzae from H. parainfluenzae. This is not possible with 16S amplicon sequencing, but highly valuable in a clinical setting. The improved detection of CF pathogens and other critical microbiome members as well as insights into their relative abundance within the community, could provide more knowledge on patient's disease status leading to more personalized medicine and ultimately benefit patient care.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale studies on the role of multivitamin-mineral (MVM) supplementation in preventing and managing acute respiratory infections (AURIs) are limited in Chinese populations. This study evaluated the impact of routine MVM use on AURI prevalence and symptom severity in a community-based Chinese cohort. This retrospective study was conducted among community-based populations across China (n=3,415). Using a structured questionnaire, participants self-reported epi-sodes of AURIs over three months. Based on regular use of MVM for at least 3 months, eligible participants were categorized into the MVM group and the control group. The impact of MVM on the frequency and severity of AURIs was assessed. Rigorous methodological approaches were applied to minimize potential biases. The period prevalence of AURIs was significantly lower in the MVM group (29.9%) compared to controls (45.6%), odds ratio (OR) =0.508 (p<0.001). After propensity score matching, demographic and lifestyle factors were comparable between groups. The period prevalence of AURIs was 31.7% and 44.8% in the MVM and control groups (OR=0.572, p<0.001). Subgroup analysis indicated the protective effect of MVM supplementation was particularly significant among participants aged ≥45 years (OR=0.407, p<0.001). The MVM group reported lower prevalence of nasal congestion (OR=0.624, p<0.001), sore throat (OR=0.575, p<0.001), headache (OR=0.642, p<0.001), diarrhea (OR=0.718, 0.026), sneezing (OR=0.651, p=0.002), and fatigue (OR=0.694, p=0.004) relative to the control group. Daily MVM supplementation for at least 3 months reduced the period prevalence of the common cold and influenza and may contribute to enhanced immune resilience in the Chinese population.",

        "abstract": "Improvements in radiation therapy (RT) for thoracic cancers have increased survival, thus preventing radiotoxicity in normal lung tissue becomes even more important. Respiratory infection is a lung stressor that increases the risk of RT toxicity. However, this risk factor remains under-studied with no effective treatment approaches. While RT is toxic to tissue-resident alveolar macrophages, recruited monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) drive fibrogenesis. We therefore investigated how these macrophage populations are impacted by a respiratory infection subsequent to lung RT. Mice received whole thorax RT (5-12.5 Gy) then influenza A virus (IAV) 1 or 20 weeks later. Chronic lung injury and acute and chronic macrophage responses were evaluated. RT plus IAV was lethal at doses that were well-tolerated when either were administered singly. IAV potentiated chronic pathology from even a benign RT dose of 5 Gy, even when IAV was delayed for 20 weeks. Macrophage dynamics shifted towards more predominant pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic MDM responses. Acutely, RT plus IAV amplified loss of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages but increased inflammatory MDMs. Expression of maturation receptors and antigen presentation factors by inflammatory MDMs decreased while pro-fibrotic factors increased. These novel findings warrant further investigation of the risks of respiratory infection for those receiving thoracic radiation.",

During the 2024-2025 US influenza season, clinicians at large pediatric centers anecdotally reported an increased number of children with influenza-associated ANE, prompting this national investigation. To understand the clinical presentation, interventions, and outcomes among US children diagnosed with influenza-associated ANE. This study was a multicenter case series of children diagnosed with ANE with longitudinal follow-up. A call for cases was issued via academic societies, public health agencies, and by directly contacting pediatric specialists at 76 US academic centers, requesting cases between October 1, 2023, and May 30, 2025. Inclusion criteria required acute encephalopathy with radiologic evidence of acute thalamic injury and laboratory confirmation of influenza infection in individuals aged 21 years or younger. Influenza-associated ANE. Presenting symptoms, vaccination history, laboratory and genetic findings, interventions, and clinical outcomes, including modified Rankin Scale score (0: no symptoms; 1-2: mild disability; 3-5: moderate to severe disability; 6: death), length of stay, and functional outcomes. Of 58 submitted cases, 41 cases (23 females; median age, 5 years [IQR, 2-8]) from 23 US hospitals met inclusion criteria. Thirty-one cases (76%) had no significant medical history; 5 (12%) were medically complex. Clinical presentation included fever in 38 patients (93%), encephalopathy in 41 (100%), and seizures in 28 (68%). Thirty-nine patients (95%) had influenza A (14 with A/H1pdm/2009, 7 with A/H3N2, and 18 with no subtype) and 2 had influenza B. Laboratory deviations included elevated liver enzymes (78%), thrombocytopenia (63%), and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein (63%). Among 32 patients (78%) with genetic testing, 15 (47%) had genetic risk alleles potentially related to risk of ANE including 11 (34%) with RANBP2 variants. Among 38 patients with available vaccination history, only 6 (16%) had received age-appropriate seasonal influenza vaccination. Most patients received multiple immunomodulatory treatments, including methylprednisolone (95%), intravenous immunoglobulin (66%), tocilizumab (51%), plasmapheresis (32%), anakinra (5%), and intrathecal methylprednisolone (5%). Median intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay were 11 days (IQR, 4-19) and 22 days (IQR, 7-36), respectively. Eleven patients (27%) died a median of 3 days (IQR, 2-4) from symptom onset, primarily from cerebral herniation (91%). Among the 27 survivors with 90-day follow-up, 63% had at least moderate disability (modified Rankin Scale score ≥3). In this case series of children with influenza-associated ANE from the 2 most recent influenza seasons in the US, the condition was associated with high morbidity and mortality in this cohort of predominantly young and previously healthy children.

The analysis compares viral detection rates and seasonal patterns post-NPI with those observed during the pre-NPI and NPI periods, as previously published. We performed a retrospective analysis of 93,852 pediatric cases of ARTIs from 2018 to 2024 at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. Virus detection rates for influenza A (IAV), influenza B (IBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus (ADV) were examined across different time periods, age groups, genders, and seasons. Post-NPI, viral detection rates rebounded (32.76%) to pre-pandemic levels, with RSV showing a sustained increase. Detection rates for IAV, IBV, and ADV also rose, but not to the same extent as pre-pandemic levels. Seasonal variations shifted, with notable rises in autumn and spring post-NPI. Gender and age-related patterns remained consistent, but age-specific susceptibility showed minimal changes compared to pre-NPI and during NPI periods. NPIs had a significant impact on the prevalence and seasonal distribution of common respiratory viruses in children. However, after the easing of restrictions, viral activity rebounded, particularly for RSV, but the patterns observed were distinct from those before the pandemic and during the NPI period. These findings underscore the lasting effects of NPIs and highlight the need for adaptive infection control strategies.",

Neonatal immune responses are reliant on innate mechanisms during the first few months of life. Interferons (IFNs) are a key component of this response. These antiviral cytokines are produced early in infection and aid in viral control and clearance. Although generally considered protective in the setting of respiratory viral infections, the recent literature has suggested that IFNs may exacerbate disease. In the process of promoting an antiviral environment, IFNs impede cell proliferation, contribute to pulmonary barrier disruption, and generate reactive oxygen species. This is not tolerated in the rapidly developing neonatal lung. Therefore, IFNs contribute to pathogenesis in the influenza-infected neonate. This review focuses on the potential mechanisms that drive IFN-induced toxicity in neonates and prospective therapeutics to mitigate this toxicity.",

In Colombia, no seroprevalence evaluation has been carried out to estimate the distribution of the virus within the country. Our aim was to perform a sero-epidemiological survey of equine influenza infections and to identify associated risk factors in horses from four departments of Colombia. Serological testing was carried out by using an ELISA for the detection of IgG antibodies against the influenza A virus. The evaluation of epidemiological variables, clinical manifestations, and vaccination history was carried out through the application of a data collection instrument. Among the 385 horses analyzed, 27% of the samples tested positive, with a higher prevalence in Study 1 from horses with respiratory symptoms (40.4%) than in Study 2 from horses without clinical signs (16.1%). Only horses housed in stables had higher odds of testing positive. The study also revealed that unvaccinated horses were 68% less likely to test positive than vaccinated horses were. This research highlights a significant gap in vaccination coverage and the presence of antibodies even in asymptomatic horses.

        "abstract": "(1) Background: The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b is an emerging threat that poses a great risk to the poultry industry. A few human cases have been linked to the infection with this clade in many parts of the world, including the USA. Unfortunately, there are no specific vaccines or antiviral drugs that could help prevent and treat the infection caused by this virus in birds. Our major objective is to identify/repurpose some (novel/known) antiviral compounds that may inhibit viral replication by targeting some key viral proteins. (2) Methods: We used state-of-the-art machine learning tools such as molecular docking and MD-simulation methods from Biovia Discovery Studio (v24.1.0.321712). The key target proteins such as hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), Matrix-2 protein (M2), and the cap-binding domain of PB2 (PB2/CBD) homology models were validated through structural assessment via DOPE scores, Ramachandran plots, and Verify-3D metrics, ensuring reliable structural representations, confirming their reliability for subsequent in silico approaches. These approaches include molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics simulation for 50 nanoseconds (ns), highlighting the structural stability and compactness of the docked complexes. (3) Results: Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities for both sofosbuvir and GS441524, particularly with the NA and PB2/CBD protein targets. Among them, GS441524 exhibited superior interaction scores and a greater number of hydrogen bonds with key functional residues of NA and PB2/CBD. The MM-GBSA binding free energy calculations further supported these findings, as GS441524 displayed more favorable binding energies compared to several known standard inhibitors, including F0045S for HA, Zanamivir for NA, Rimantadine and Amantadine for M2, and PB2-39 for PB2/CBD. Additionally, 50 ns molecular dynamics simulations highlighted the structural stability and compactness of the GS441524-PB2/CBD complex, further supporting its potential as a promising antiviral candidate. Furthermore, hydrogen bond monitor analysis over the 50 ns simulation confirmed persistent and specific interactions between the ligand and proteins, suggesting that GS441524 may effectively inhibit the NA, and PB2/CBD might potentially disrupt PB2-mediated RNA synthesis. (4) Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with previous evidence supporting the antiviral activity of certain nucleoside analog inhibitors, including GS441524, against various coronaviruses. These results further support the potential repurposing of GS441524 as a promising therapeutic candidate against H5N1 avian influenza clade 2.3.4.4b. However, further functional studies are required to validate these in silico predictions and support the inhibitory action of GS441524 against the targeted proteins of H5N1, specifically clade 2.3.4.4b.",

In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy in vivo of a DIM formulation with fish oil (Cesarox Epi) against influenza A (H1N1) infection in mice and against SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters. In a model of lethal influenza pneumonia induced by A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 virus, we showed that 5 days' treatment with DIM Epi at 10, 20, and 60 mg/kg/day delayed the time to death, prevented body weight loss, and resulted in significant improvements in survival. DIM Epi tested in hamsters infected with SARS-CoV2 Dubrovka (Wuhan-like) strain at doses 50 and 100 mg/kg/day reduced clinical signs, weight loss, temperature elevation, and lung pathology. In both models of infections, treatment with DIM Epi did not significantly decrease viral titer in the animals' lungs. DIM Epi and Oseltamivir were more effective against influenza infection when given in combination than given singly, while co-administration of DIM Epi with Molnupiravir did not yield an additive benefit against SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings support DIM Epi as a promising host-directed adjunct therapy for viral pneumonia with potential to enhance outcomes in respiratory infections.",

Over time, the unprecedented rise of new and re-emerging zoonotic diseases has prompted the need for rapid and effective vaccine development. Following the success of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, mRNA-based platforms hold great promise due to their rapid design, swift development and ability to elicit robust immune responses, thereby highlighting their potential in combating emerging and pre-pandemic zoonotic viruses. In recent years, several mRNA vaccines targeting emerging and re-emerging zoonotic viral diseases, such as rabies, Nipah, Zika, and influenza, have advanced to clinical trials, demonstrating promising immunogenicity.

        "abstract": "The H5N1 avian influenza virus continues to evolve into genetically diverse and highly pathogenic clades with increased potential for cross-species transmission. Recent scientific advances have included the development of next-generation vaccine platforms, promising antiviral compounds, and more sensitive diagnostic tools, alongside strengthened surveillance systems in both animals and humans. However, persistent structural challenges hinder global readiness. Vaccine production is heavily concentrated in high-income countries, limiting equitable access during potential pandemics. Economic and logistical barriers complicate the implementation of control strategies such as vaccination, culling, and compensation schemes. Gaps in international coordination, public communication, and standardization of protocols further exacerbate vulnerabilities. Although sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented, the severity of confirmed infections and the rapid global spread among wildlife and domestic animals underscore the urgent need for robust preparedness. International organizations have called for comprehensive pandemic response plans, enhanced multisectoral collaboration, and investment in targeted research. Priorities include expanding surveillance to asymptomatic animal hosts, evaluating viral shedding and transmission routes, and developing strain-specific and universal vaccines.

        "abstract": "The evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its impact on public health continue to demand attention as the virus continues to evolve, demonstrating a remarkable ability to adapt to diverse selective pressures including immune responses, therapeutic treatments, and prophylactic interventions. The SARS-CoV-2 variant landscape remains dynamic, with new subvariants continuously emerging, many harboring spike protein mutations linked to immune evasion. In this study, we characterized a panel of live SARS-CoV-2 strains, including those key subvariants implicated in recent waves of infection. Our findings revealed a significant variability in mutation patterns in the spike protein across the strains analyzed. Commercial antibodies and human convalescent plasma (HCoP) samples from unvaccinated donors were ineffective in neutralizing the most recent Omicron subvariants, particularly after the emergence of JN.1 subvariant. Using human airway epithelial cells derived from healthy bronchiolar tissue (hBAEC), we established both monoinfections and coinfections involving SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A virus H1N1 (IFAV_H1N1) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Assessments were conducted to compare viral infectivity and the production and release of immune mediators in the apical and basolateral compartments. Notably, Omicron KP.3.1.1 subvariant induced a more pronounced cytopathic effect in hBAEC compared to its parental strain JN.1 and even surpassed the impact observed with the ancestral wild-type virus (WA1/2020, Washington strain). Furthermore, the coinfection of KP.3.1.1 subvariant with IFAV_H1N1 or RSV did not attenuate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity; instead, it significantly exacerbated the pathogenic synergy in the lung epithelium. Our study demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IFN-β, and IL-10 were upregulated in hBAEC following SARS-CoV-2 monoinfection with recent Omicron subvariants as well as during coinfection with IFAV_H1N1 and RSV. Taken together, our findings offer new insights into the immune evasion strategies and pathogenic potential of evolving SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants, as well as their interactions with other respiratory viruses, carrying important implications for therapeutic development and public health preparedness.",

        "abstract": "The ongoing global threat posed by the influenza A virus, exacerbated by antigenic drift and the emergence of antiviral resistance, accentuates the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Through molecular docking, this study revealed that mangiferin has a strong binding affinity for the active site of the neuraminidase (NA) protein of influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09, with a binding energy of -8.1 kcal/mol. In vitro assays confirmed a dose-dependent inhibition of NA, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 88.65 μM, and minimal cytotoxicity, as indicated by a CC<sub>50</sub> of 328.1 μM in MDCK cells. In murine models, the administration of mangiferin at a dosage of 25 mg/kg significantly mitigated weight loss, decreased viral loads in nasal turbinates and lungs by over 1 log10 TCID<sub>50</sub>, and enhanced survival rates from 0% in control groups to 20% in mangiferin-treated group at 14 days post-infection. In addition, mangiferin was found to modulate host immune responses by simultaneously inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α, and upregulating the expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and antiviral IFN-γ, thus mitigating infection-induced inflammation. Our findings elucidate the dual mechanism of mangiferin involving the direct inhibition of NA and immunomodulation, thereby providing experimental evidence for exploring dual-mechanism-based anti-influenza strategies against resistant strains of influenza.",

        "abstract": "Polyphenols are structurally diverse plant metabolites that have attracted significant interest. Their compositions are versatile, depending on their structures, including the number of rings in the polyphenol composition. Based on these attributes, polyphenols can be classified as flavanols, anthocyanins, flavones, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and lignans. Polyphenols mainly possess inhibition of viral replication, interference with viral protein synthesis, and modulation of immune responses, providing significant antiviral effects against several viruses, including herpes simplex virus, hepatitis C virus, and influenza. They are crucial for medical compounds in diverse, versatile treatments, namely in diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative problems. Plants are the primary source of bioactive molecules, which are valued for their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and antiviral activities. Especially, polyphenols are extracted as the most abundant bioactive compounds of plants. Moreover, viral infections are one of the major factors in illnesses and diseases, along with bacteria and fungi. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies report antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, Mayaro virus, dengue virus, herpesvirus, and influenza A virus, though clinical validation remains limited. Additionally, inhibition of viral entry, interference with viral replication, modulation of host immune response, and direct virucidal effects were examined.",

Our previous study observed that the relative abundance of <i>Lactobacillus murinus</i> (<i>L. murinus</i>) was significantly reduced in both the respiratory tract and gut of IAV-infected mice and negatively correlated with the severity of IAV-MRSA coinfection pneumonia, but the role of <i>L. murinus</i> remains unclear. Here, we supplemented the respiratory tract and gut of IAV-infected mice with live <i>L. murinus</i> and performed a secondary MRSA infection challenge to investigate the effects and potential mechanisms further. Data showed that <i>L. murinus</i> supplementation significantly reduced mortality and pathogen loads in IAV-MRSA coinfected mice and upregulated the lung T cell-independent (TI) IgA response in IAV-infected mice. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing results showed that <i>L. murinus</i> supplementation ameliorated microbiota composition disorder and regulated metabolic dysfunction in the gut of IAV-infected mice. The correlation analysis and antibiotic cocktail treatment experiment showed that the TI IgA response in lungs is dependent on gut microbiota. These findings demonstrated that <i>L. murinus</i> supplementation reduces susceptibility to secondary MRSA infection in IAV-infected mice by promoting the TI IgA response, and provide a new perspective on the use of probiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection following IAV infection.",

        "abstract": "The global burden of respiratory viral infections is notable, which is attributed to their higher transmissibility compared to other viral diseases. Respiratory viruses are seen to have evolved resistance to available treatment options. Although vaccines and antiviral drugs control some respiratory viruses, this control is limited due to unexpected events, such as mutations and the development of antiviral resistance. The technology of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) has been emerging as a novel technology in viral therapeutics. These are small molecules that can selectively degrade target proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. PROTACs as a therapy were initially developed against cancer, but they have recently shown promising results in their antiviral mechanisms by targeting viral and/or host proteins involved in the pathogenesis of viral infections. In this review, we elaborate on the antiviral potential of PROTACs as therapeutic agents and their potential as vaccine components against important respiratory viral pathogens, including influenza viruses, coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2), and respiratory syncytial virus. Advanced applications of PROTAC antiviral strategies, such as hemagglutinin and neuraminidase degraders for influenza and spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2, are detailed in this review. Additionally, the role of PROTACs in targeting cellular mechanisms within the host, thereby preventing viral pathogenesis and eliciting an antiviral effect, is discussed. The potential of PROTACs as vaccines, utilizing proteasome-based virus attenuation to achieve a robust protective immune response, while ensuring safety and enhancing efficient production, is also presented. With the promises exhibited by PROTACs, this technology faces significant challenges, including the emergence of novel viral strains, tissue-specific expression of E3 ligases, and pharmacokinetic constraints. With advanced computational design in molecular platforms, PROTAC-based antiviral development offers an alternative, transformative path in tackling respiratory viruses.",

        "abstract": "Influenza vaccination remains one of the best tools available to prevent severe disease in individuals at high risk of influenza complications. Yet, influenza vaccination among older adults and those at high risk of severe outcomes has remained low in Canada and other countries even when the vaccine is routinely recommended. Assessing the prevalence of influenza vaccination coverage over time and factors associated with missed vaccination can provide evidence to inform efforts to improve coverage. Among adults aged ≥ 65 years and adults aged 49-64 years with one or more chronic medical condition (CMC), we aimed to (1) estimate the prevalence of missed influenza vaccination and (2) evaluate factors associated with missed vaccination using recent data from a large national survey of Canadian adults. We analyzed data collected by the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging during follow-up 2 from 2018 to 2021. Participants were asked to self-report whether they received an influenza vaccine in the year prior to completing the survey. We estimated the prevalence of missed vaccination overall and by participant characteristics. We assessed factors associated with missed vaccination using logistic regression and report adjusted odds ratios among adults aged ≥ 65 years and adults aged 49-64 years with ≥ 1 CMC. Among the 18,894 participants surveyed, 27.0% (95% CI: 26.1, 27.8%) of those aged 65 years and older and 45.2% (95% CI: 43.7, 46.8%) of those aged 49-64 years with ≥ 1 CMC reported not receiving influenza vaccination within the prior year. For both groups, reporting receiving influenza vaccination in the previous CLSA wave of data collection (2015-2017) and contact with a family doctor within the prior year were strongly associated with lower odds of missed influenza vaccination. Our analysis suggests that a large proportion of eligible Canadian adults at higher risk of severe complications due to influenza are not receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine, despite recommendations. These estimates and this detailed analysis provide important insights into trends in influenza vaccination coverage among older adults and can serve as a baseline assessment for tracking changes in influenza vaccination coverage over time and in the years following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",

        "abstract": "The healthcare-seeking behavior for acute respiratory infection (ARI) is a crucial denominator in estimating the respiratory disease burden. This study aimed to assess the healthcare-seeking behaviors among community residents with ARI and identify key factors influencing their healthcare preference. A cross-sectional community questionnaire survey was carried out in Wanzhou, a district in southwest China, following the winter-spring influenza peaks in the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 seasons. Employing post-stratified estimation and chi-square tests, we adjusted and compared healthcare-seeking rates. We used multinomial logistic regression to discern the factors influencing medical behaviors. We collected questionnaires from 9,702 residents of 52 communities. Following demographic adjustment, approximately 19% of the community population had ARI symptoms, with 45% of those infected seeking medical assistance. Compared with the 2021-2022 season, the survey in the 2022-2023 season showed ARI prevalence had an upsurge in individuals aged ≥ 60 (from 21.48 to 26.33%) and among those earning a monthly income below 1000 RMB (from 19.91 to 35.51%), while healthcare-seeking rate showed a significant downtrend for the above groups (from 61.11 to 49.05% for the elderly and 48.45 to 34.17% for low-income individuals). ARI cases had the highest preference of primary healthcare institutions in the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 seasons (16.58% and 22.06%). The key factors influencing the ARI inclination towards primary healthcare institutions included geographical proximity, familiarity with doctors, educational qualification at or below the primary school, and being a designated facility under medical insurance. Prioritizing the enhancement of geographical convenience and economic measures for particularly vulnerable groups, especially the elderly and low-income populations, is an essential public health strategy in promoting more equitable and timely access to health services. Enhancing the professional capabilities of primary medical institutions in managing acute respiratory infections, specifically through an expanded range of pharmaceuticals, advanced treatment equipment, and a well-trained medical workforce, will help to ease the burden on secondary or tertiary hospitals during the seasonal peaks of ARI.",

There is an increasing expectation that surveillance data will support the modeling of future short-term disease scenarios using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). This study examines how influenza surveillance can support AI/ML-based short-term forecasting for influenza at the community and hospital levels in a high-income country setting (Aotearoa/New Zealand). This study used a two-phase approach. The first phase involved a comprehensive review of government reports, official websites, and literature to characterize existing influenza surveillance systems. The second phase evaluated systems against eight key attributes-timeliness, sensitivity, specificity, representativeness, coverage, robustness, completeness, and historical data-using a five-level ranking system. Attribute selection was informed by experts' knowledge, ML requirements, and established frameworks. Weighted scores for training and short-term forecasting capabilities were calculated to determine alignment with AI/ML requirements. The Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance (SHIVERS) community cohort and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) hospital surveillance emerged as the most useful systems, achieving the highest scores in both training and short-term forecasting in community and hospital settings, respectively. The National Minimum Dataset of hospitalizations and mortality datasets demonstrated strong training potential but are limited in short-term forecasting due to timeliness constraints. Additionally, laboratory-based surveillance performs a useful role in bridging community and hospital datasets. A set of key attributes is useful for assessing which influenza surveillance systems are best aligned with AI/ML training and short-term forecasting requirements. These attributes distinguished systems that are likely to be the most suitable for modeling future short-term disease scenarios for influenza at the community and hospital levels in New Zealand. Integrating these data sources could enhance influenza forecasts to improve public health responses and intervention planning.",

However, suboptimal efficacy and risk of drug resistance development remain major challenges. Molnupiravir, a ribonucleoside analog, was originally developed to treat influenza, but was repurposed and first approved for treating COVID-19 in 2021. Considering their complementary mode-of-actions, this study aimed to investigate the combinatorial activities of oseltamivir and molnupiravir against influenza virus infections. In cell culture models, we found that β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC), the active form of molnupiravir, exerted more potent antiviral activities against influenza A and B viruses, when compared to oseltamivir treatment. Combination of NHC with oseltamivir exhibited a synergistic antiviral effect against the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 strain, but not the influenza B/Washington/02/2019 strain. In a mouse model infected with the PR/8 virus strain, treatment with molnupiravir alone or in combination with oseltamivir effectively attenuated lung injury and reduced viral load in the tissue. Taken together, molnupiravir can be explored in combination with oseltamivir to treat influenza, especially for patients infected with the oseltamivir-resistant strains, whereas further research is warranted.",

This study systematically characterizes the epidemiological and clinical phenotypes of SARI patients in Shouguang county, Shandong Province, China. A prospective observational study was conducted at Shouguang People's Hospital between August 28, 2023 and April 30, 2024, enrolling 1,730 hospitalized patients with SARI from the Departments of Infectious Diseases and Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. Standardized electronic case report forms were used to systematically collect the demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations and laboratory testing results. Oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected within 24 hours of admission for each patient and stored at -80°C. Multiplex real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using the ABI 7500 system to detect 11 respiratory viruses infection, including influenza A virus (IFA), influenza B virus (IFB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (HPIV), human coronaviruses (HCoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus (HRV), enterovirus (EV), human bocavirus (HBoV), human adenovirus (HAdV), and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). 501 samples (28.96%) were tested positive for at least one virus. The most frequently detected viruses and their infection rates were as follows: IFA (11.33%), COVID-19 (6.53%), HPIV (2.31%), HCoV (2.20%), RSV (1.79%), IFB (1.68%), HMPV (1.56%), EV (0.64%), HADV (0.52%), and HBoV (0.06%). Among patients aged 0-14 years, IFA and EV had the highest infection rates, both at 9.46% (7/74). In the 15-24 age group, IFA exhibited the highest infection rate at 19.70% (26/132). In patients aged ≥70 years, COVID-19 was the most frequently detected virus, with a infection rate of 10.69% (65/608). The overall virus infection rate peaked at 60.00% (30/50) in epidemiological week 48 of 2023. During weeks 46-50 of 2023, the overall infection rate remained consistently high (range: 28.42-60.00%). Significant differences in infection rates were observed across hospital departments (χ² = 5.52, P < 0.05), The Department of Infectious Diseases demonstrated a higher infection rate of 34.91% (162/464) compared to 29.07% (368/1266) in the Department of Respiratory Medicine. Viral etiological analysis of SARI patients in Eastern China identified IFA, COVID-19, and HPIV as the three predominant virus, with influenza virus exhibiting the highest frequency of co-infection with other respiratory viruses. Our study further revealed significant heterogeneity in virus distribution across different hospital departments, age groups, and admission periods. The most common clinical manifestations were cough and fever, with distinct symptomatic profiles observed among infections caused by different viruss. These findings provide scientific evidence to inform government strategies for optimizing the prevention and management of respiratory infectious diseases.",

        "abstract": "The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 after SARS-CoV-2 infection varies greatly, with many patients requiring intensive care due to complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome, reduced respiratory system compliance, and altered iron metabolism, which can be mistaken for worsening Influenza A infection. This highlights the need to study the humoral immune response to better understand the pathophysiology of viral respiratory infections and improve treatments and diagnostics. This study analyzed autoantibody and acute-phase reactant profiles in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A using customized protein microarrays for sensitive and reproducible results. The findings revealed a significant increase in autoantibodies in SARS-CoV-2 patients, including those targeting calcitonin-related polypeptides, hepatocyte growth factor, or interleukin 8, compared to Influenza A patients, who showed elevated levels of selectin E and surfactant protein D. Additionally, most acute-phase reactants were higher in SARS-CoV-2 patients. The serological profile showed that the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain induced both IgM and IgG responses to all viral proteins, while other strains triggered an IgG response only at a later stage. Multiomics factor analysis identified key factors driving variation in COVID-19's heterogeneous disease presentation. These insights offer valuable information for developing vaccines and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.",

The objective was to identify differences between established vaccination guidelines and actual practices in healthcare as experienced by patients. Among eligible responders (<i>n</i> = 1434), 57% were on immunomodulatory treatment, and 59% were treated in specialized care. The most recommended vaccines were COVID-19 (66%), influenza (63%), and pneumococcal (46%). Regarding common vaccination principles for patients with CID, 61% reported not receiving information on vaccinations before treatment initiation. Only 23% were advised to check their vaccination status before starting medications, and just 20% reported that their vaccination status is regularly assessed. Logistic regression revealed that the DD group was less likely, while patients over 65 years of age or on immunomodulatory treatment were more likely to be recommended and receive vaccinations. Ideally, all CID patients should be eligible for preventive immunization starting from the time of diagnosis. A targeted vaccination program with clear responsibilities across the healthcare system is strongly recommended.",

However, its therapeutic effects against influenza and its anti-inflammatory mechanisms remain unclear. Active compounds and targets were identified using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database platform, OMIM database, and GeneCards database. Protein-protein interaction networks and compound-target networks were constructed to screen core targets and components. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed using the DAVID database, and the results were visualized via the Microbioinformatics platform. Molecular docking was employed to evaluate the binding affinity between potential targets and active compounds. Finally, cytopathic effect assays and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments were conducted for validation. Network pharmacology studies revealed that AKT1, EGFR, and SRC are core targets of MHD in treating influenza, with kaempferol, quercetin, and luteolin as key compounds. The mechanism of MHD is closely associated with antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immune-regulatory effects. Cytopathic effect assays and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments confirmed the therapeutic effects of key compounds against H1N1. This study demonstrates that MHD exhibits anti-H1N1 viral activity and comprehensively elucidates its active components, potential targets, and molecular mechanisms in influenza treatment. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for further exploration of MHD's protective effects and anti-inflammatory mechanisms against influenza.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> COVID-19, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are major respiratory infections with overlapping clinical presentations. Comparative data on the severity of these infections in hospitalized adults are limited, particularly across phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Objectives:</b> The objectives of this study are to compare the risk of severe outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, influenza, or RSV and to evaluate the role of vaccination and demographic subgroups using recent, real-world data. <b>Design:</b> This is a retrospective cohort study. Setting: Eight hospitals within the Corewell Health system in Michigan, USA, were studied. <b>Participants:</b> The participants included adults aged ≥ 18 years hospitalized between 1 January 2021 and 20 July 2024 with a principal diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or RSV. <b>Main Outcomes and Measures:</b> The primary outcome was a composite of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs), with subgroup analyses in terms of vaccination status, age group, and time period. <b>Results:</b> Among 27,885 hospitalized patients (90.5% COVID-19, 7.2% influenza, 2.3% RSV), COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of severe outcomes compared to influenza (aHR 1.30, 95% CI: 1.11-1.54). RSV showed no significant difference from influenza. Across all infection groups, older age (≥65 years), high comorbidity burden, and immunocompromised status were associated with an increased risk of severe outcomes. Recent COVID-19 vaccination was protective, particularly among older adults. Differences in severity were more pronounced in the pre-March 2022 period. <b>Conclusions:</b> Using one of the most recent large-scale datasets, this study is among the first to directly compare the severity of COVID-19, influenza, and RSV in hospitalized adults. COVID-19 continues to pose a higher risk of severe illness compared to the other viral infections. The findings underscore the importance of up-to-date vaccination and focused clinical strategies for older and high-risk individuals. This study offers timely evidence to guide future respiratory virus response strategies across hospital settings.",

In this study, we evaluated the in vitro antiviral activity of a marine bacterial extract derived from <i>Parerythrobacter</i> sp. M20A3S10 against IAV (H1N1; H3N2), influenza B virus (IBV), ZIKV, and DENV2. The extract demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral effects with favorable selectivity indices across multiple host-derived epithelial cell lines. Notably, post-infection treatment significantly suppressed viral replication, suggesting a host-modulating or replication-inhibiting mechanism. While the extract's active components have yet to be identified, bacteria from the <i>Erythrobacteraceae</i> family are known producers of bioactive metabolites with potential antiviral properties. These findings provide preliminary insight into the potential of marine-derived bacterial compounds in veterinary antiviral development and highlight the need for further characterization and in vivo validation.

        "abstract": "A collaborative effort by the National Institute of Health, Pakistan and the World Health Organization initiated RSV surveillance in children under 2 years old in 2019 in Pakistan. This study aimed to characterise RSV disease, assess genetic diversity of circulating subtypes, and reconstruct the evolutionary history and transmission dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nasal swabs were collected weekly from five sites across three seasons (2019-2022). A subset of samples was sequenced and studied using the BEAST phylodynamic framework. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to explore associations between patient characteristics and infection odds. Out of 758 samples collected, 18.7% tested positive for RSV, mostly RSV-A (93.6%). Influenza A and B positivity rates were 4.2% and 6.3%, respectively. RSV positivity increased from 13% in 2019-2020 to 32.1% in 2020-2021, likely due to the wide spread of respiratory infection and limited implementation of preventive measures. These rates later dropped to 10.0% (2021-22), suggesting a possible re-implementation of such measures. Mutational analysis revealed a unique P376S mutation within the F-4-2 epitopic region of the F gene of one Pakistani virus, which contributes to viral protein oligomerization. The phylodynamic inference revealed predominant circulation of RSV-A over a wider geographical region, reflecting a combination of continual viral entry, with three introductions in 2020, and one each in 2017 and 2018, and one event of persistence across seasons. The observed introductions likely stemmed from Pakistani nationals returning from Europe to their home country. Combined RSV surveillance and phylodynamic modeling effectively uncovers RSV transmission patterns and provides valuable insights for the development and deployment of RSV vaccination and treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy characterized by profound immunosuppression resulting from both disease-related mechanisms and treatment-induced immune dysfunction. This compromised immune status markedly increases susceptibility to infections, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in MM patients. While vaccination represents a cornerstone of infection prevention, standard immunization strategies often yield suboptimal responses in this population. This review synthesizes current evidence on the immunological barriers and clinical effectiveness of vaccination in MM. We evaluate vaccines targeting influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae, SARS-CoV-2, and other relevant pathogens, and explore determinants influencing vaccine efficacy, including optimal timing, formulation, and patient-specific immune parameters. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, encompassing clinical trials, retrospective cohort studies, expert consensus guidelines, and population-based data. Extracted outcomes included serological responses, infection-related events, and vaccine safety in MM patients. Patients with MM exhibit impaired vaccine responses due to hypogammaglobulinemia, T- and B-cell dysfunction, and therapy-induced lymphodepletion. Despite modest immunogenicity, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines reduce respiratory infections and hospitalizations. Sequential administration of PCV13 followed by PPSV23, as well as post-autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) three-dose regimens, is associated with reduced pneumonia incidence. COVID-19 vaccines elicit variable responses, particularly in patients on anti-CD38 or BCMA-targeted therapies, highlighting the need for booster doses and, in selected cases, prophylactic monoclonal antibodies. Vaccines against herpes zoster, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B are also recommended, particularly around ASCT. Immunophenotypic markers such as CD19+ B-cell and CD4+ T-cell counts are predictive of vaccine responsiveness, supporting immune profiling as a tool for individualized vaccination planning. Vaccination remains a critical component of infection prevention in MM. Although immunogenicity may be attenuated, clinical benefits-namely, reduced infection burden and healthcare utilization-support broad vaccine implementation. A personalized approach, considering the treatment phase, disease control, and immune status, is essential to optimize vaccine effectiveness. Ongoing research into high-dose, adjuvanted, and next-generation vaccines is critical to enhance protection in this vulnerable population.",

        "abstract": "Viral lung infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite significant advances in vaccines and antivirals, there remains a tremendous need for broadly applicable treatments that can be utilized across viral infections. Prior to infecting epithelial cells, viruses interact with the epithelial glycocalyx, which contains high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMWHA), a glycosaminoglycan that has beneficial effects in lung injury. To determine the role of HMWHA in viral pneumonia. We infected mice with Influenza or SARS-Cov2 and treated with prophylactic or therapeutic doses of HMWHA or saline control. We performed in vitro experiments of infection with viruses of respiratory and non-respiratory human and animal cells and evaluated the effect of HMWHA on infection. We analyzed existing databases for expression of hyaluronan and the transcription factor E2F1. Finally, we performed a clinical trial with HMWHA in patients with severe COVID-19 Measurements and Main Results: Exogenously applied HMWHA improved survival in SARS-CoV2 and influenza infection in mice, by ameliorating inflammation via the inhibition of E2F1. In a clinical study, inhaled HMWHA improved outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19. Furthermore, airway epithelia naturally express HMWHA, which is induced during viral infection and prevents infection via macromolecular crowding of viruses. Our data provide a mechanistic justification for the use of HMWHA as a broadly effective prophylactic and therapeutic agent in viral airway infection.

        "abstract": "Children are the main group affected by the influenza virus, posing challenges to their health. The high risk of viral variability, drug resistance, and drug development leads to a scarcity of therapeutic drugs. Baikening (BKN) granules are a marketed traditional Chinese medicine used to treat children's lung heat, asthma, whooping cough, etc. Therefore, exploring the potential mechanisms of BKN in treating pediatric influenza is of great significance for discovering new drugs. Through the database, we obtained differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pediatric influenza and healthy samples, identified the components of BKN, and collected the targets. Target networks were built with the purpose of screening both targets and key components. Pathway and function enrichment were conducted on the relevant targets of BKN for treating pediatric influenza. BKN-related hub genes for influenza were discovered through DEGs, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), BKN-cluster WGCNA, and machine learning model. The accuracy of prediction efficiency and the value of BKN-related hub gene were validated through analysis of external datasets and receiver operating characteristics. Ultimately, simulations using molecular docking and molecular dynamics were used to forecast how active components will bind to hub genes. A total of 20 candidate active compounds, 58 potential targets, and 3,819 DEGs were identified. The target network screened the top 10 key components and 6 core targets (PPARG, MMP2, GSK3B, PARP1, CCNA2, and IGF1). Potential target enrichment analysis indicated that BKN may be involved in AMPK signaling pathway, PI3K Akt signaling pathway, etc., to combat pediatric influenza. Subsequently, two hub genes (OTOF, IFI27) were obtained through WGCNA, BKN-cluster WGCNA, and machine learning models as potential biomarkers for BKN-related pediatric influenza. Two hub genes were found to have primary diagnostic value based on ROC curve analysis. Molecular docking confirmed the binding between BKN and hub gene. Molecular dynamics further revealed the stable binding between Peimisine and hub genes. BKN may alleviate pediatric influenza via key components targeting core targets (PPARG, MMP2, GSK3B, PARP1, CCNA2, and IGF1) and hub genes (OTOF, IFI27), with the involvement of feature genes-related pathways. These results have potential consequences for future research and clinical practice.",

Recurrent coughing in pediatric patients presents diagnostic challenges when multiple pathogens and antibiotic resistance are involved. Despite receiving traditional Chinese medicine and antibiotic treatments, the patient's symptoms persisted. The initial diagnosis failed to identify the cause, although blood tests showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A, and chest X-rays indicated signs of bronchopneumonia. The patient tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus and <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>, with a <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> antibody titer of 1:40. Despite treatment with azithromycin, ambroxol, and nebulization, the cough symptoms did not improve, leading to multiple hospital admissions. Subsequent targeted sequencing confirmed infections by <i>Bordetella pertussis</i>, human rhinovirus A, adenovirus type 2, and SARS-CoV-2 at different stages. Notably, genomic analysis during the first hospital stay discovered an A2047G mutation in the 23S rRNA gene of <i>B. pertussis</i>, indicating resistance to macrolide drugs; however, subsequent tests showed that this mutation had disappeared. This case highlights the complexity of diagnosing and treating persistent cough in pediatric patients and underscores the importance of targeted next-generation sequencing in identifying resistance and co-infections, ultimately enabling more precise and effective treatment strategies for challenging respiratory infections in children.",

The movement and gathering of attendees from other cities and countries posed challenges to local public health, including an increased risk of infectious diseases or outbreaks. To manage these risks, a syndromic surveillance system targeting infectious diseases was established. This system aimed to identify suspicious cases and outbreaks early, enabling timely measures and minimizing their impact. This article reviews the surveillance mechanism, analyzes the surveillance data, and evaluates the system's effectiveness. The mechanism of the syndromic surveillance system was described, and surveillance data were collected to evaluate strategies for infectious disease prevention and control during the Universiade. Epidemiological distributions of diseases were described, and differences were tested using chi-squared tests. Surveillance was carried out among athletes, coaches, entourages, and staff from 1 week before the competition to 1 week after. The surveillance focused on symptoms such as fever, cough, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, jaundice, conjunctival redness, and sore throat, supported by a self-developed <i>Cloud Health Information System for Health Care Support</i> and <i>Syndromic Surveillance System for Infectious Disease</i>. A total of 351 subjects with disease-related symptoms, mainly including sore throat, cough, and fever, were reported. A total of 33 events of clustered symptoms were detected, none of which met the criteria for an outbreak. Fifty cases were confirmed with infectious diseases, comprising 43 cases of COVID-19, 3 cases of influenza, and 1 case each of infectious mononucleosis, chikungunya, malaria, and another infectious diarrhea. Throughout the event, reports of disease-related symptoms were sporadically distributed, with no secondary cases or outbreaks detected and no health-related risks arising that would impact the continuation of the event. The syndromic surveillance system was sensitive and effective for the early detection and control of infectious disease outbreaks and could be implemented in other mass-gathering events.",

        "abstract": "This statement updates the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for the use of influenza vaccines and antiviral medications in the prevention and treatment of influenza in children during the 2025-2026 influenza season. A review of the evidence supporting these recommendations is in the accompanying technical report (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2025-073622). The AAP recommends annual influenza vaccination of all children without medical contraindications starting at 6 months of age. Influenza vaccination is an important strategy for protecting children and the broader community as well as reducing the overall burden of respiratory illnesses when other viruses are cocirculating. Any licensed influenza vaccine appropriate for age and health status can be administered, as soon as possible in the season, without preference for one product or formulation. Antiviral treatment of influenza is recommended for children with suspected or confirmed influenza who are hospitalized or have severe or progressive disease or have underlying conditions that increase their risk of complications of influenza. In this situation, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible regardless of duration of illness. Antiviral treatment is an option in the outpatient setting for other children with suspected or confirmed influenza in some circumstances. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis is an option in certain individuals, especially exposed children who are asymptomatic and are at high risk for influenza complications but have not yet been immunized or those who are not expected to mount an effective immune response.",

        "abstract": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection caused by the MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Due to its high mortality and lack of a vaccine or treatment, MERS has remained on the WHO's priority list of diseases with the highest public health risk since 2012. Although rapid diagnosis is essential for interrupting transmission, initiating timely treatment, and maintaining public health systems, no rapid diagnostic method currently exists for MERS. In this study, a sensitive and specific lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA)-based rapid antigen diagnostic test for MERS was developed using time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) technology. Monoclonal antibodies specific for the MERS-CoV N protein were generated, and optimal pairs were selected through affinity measurement. A TRF-LFIA using Europium nanoparticles was then constructed based on these pairs. The TRF-LFIA showed a detection limit of 0.1 ng/ml MERS-CoV N protein and 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> copies/ml of MERS-CoV, demonstrating a 25-fold sensitivity increase relative to the cellulose nanobeads (CNB)-LFIA. Furthermore, it displayed high specificity without cross-reactivity to the N proteins of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, or influenza virus. Consequently, these findings indicate that the TRF-LFIA platform is a promising approach for rapid diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection, with potential for broader application through enhanced sensitivity.",

The tendency of increasing mortality from NCDs due to increase in the number and aging of the population is noted. The data is presented testifying that, in addition to biological risk factors, influence of environmental factors is increasing, including atmospheric and household air pollution, the levels of which are high in a significant number of countries. It is emphasized that green spaces (e.g., trees, grass, forests and parks) and blue spaces (e.g., lakes, rivers, ponds, etc.) provide beneficial effect on human health, being in fact protective factors for NCDs. The NCD risk factors are found to interact closely with each other: air pollution, depression, tobacco smoking, high blood pressure and obesity have been linked to all NCDs. The evidence is provided that presence of behavioral risk factors for NCDs exacerbates severity of infectious pathology, particularly COVID-19 and other infectious diseases (influenza, HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis, etc.). Given that NCD risk factors can occur in early childhood, promoting healthy lifestyles among expectant mothers and adolescents should be a priority to reduce NCD risks, especially in low- and middle-income countries.",

        "abstract": "Influenza causes 3-5 million severe cases globally each year, with severe viral pneumonia often requiring hospitalization for over four weeks. While the inflammatory response to influenza infection helps control viral replication, excessive inflammation is a key driver of disease severity and mortality. Excessive pulmonary lymphocytes, particularly IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes, contribute significantly to pulmonary inflammation at the late-stage of H1N1 viral infection. Cyclosporin A, a potent T-cell inhibitor, mitigates influenza A virus-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice. However, the therapeutic role of lymphocyte suppression in cyclosporin A-mediated attenuation of H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the viral titer was 0 in all the homogenized lung tissues of mice on Day-21 post a sublethal H1N1 viral infection. H1N1 viral infection caused worsened general condition and pulmonary inflammation with the infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils on Day-21 post-infection. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of H1N1 virus-infected mice showed a 16-fold higher lymphocyte count compared to neutrophils. H1N1 viral infection significantly elevated both IFN-γ-producing T lymphocyte populations and IFN-γ levels in mouse lungs. H1N1 viral infection additionally expanded IFN-γ-producing T lymphocyte populations in both spleen and peripheral blood. Cyclosporin A treatment significantly mitigated H1N1 viral infection-induced worsened general condition, pulmonary lymphocytic inflammation, increases of pulmonary IFN-γ concentrations and IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes in the lung, spleen and blood of mice on Day-21 post-infection. Together, lymphocytes may contribute significantly to H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation. Cyclosporin A may alleviate H1N1 virus-induced chronic pulmonary inflammation through decreasing IFN-γ-producing T lymphocytes.",

The severity of SARS-CoV-2 varies widely, and collective serum immune factors, evaluated in emergency care patients, have not been shown to correlate with disease progression. We applied a machine learning approach to reassess and define serum immune profiles that could align with clinical laboratory parameters and predict disease outcomes in patients with respiratory virus infections, including those with SARS-CoV-2, seeking emergency care. Sixty-two plasma immune molecules, in a cohort of 67 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2, were analyzed for correlation with antibodies (Abs) to spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, as well as with clinical laboratory parameters, to identify early indicators of disease prognosis at hospital admission. This approach allowed us to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets, delineating three distinct serum immune signatures. Two showed significant and opposite modulations, correlating with poorer disease outcomes, while most patients with moderate disease displayed modest immune factor dysregulation. This highlights the complexity of immune responses in the severity of diseases caused by highly respiratory pathogenic virus like SARS-CoV-2, emphasizing the importance of evaluating overall immune imbalance rather than focusing on a few dysregulated factors.",

        "abstract": "The broad-spectrum insect growth regulator (IGR) and insecticide 2-((1-(4-Phenoxyphenoxy)propan-2-yl)oxy)pyridine (MPEP; also known as pyriproxyfen) is increasingly being used to address public health programs for vector control, initiated by the spread of Zika virus in 2015-2016. While considered relatively safe for humans under normal conditions, limited toxicology data are available. Current studies were undertaken to address the data gap regarding potential immunotoxicity of MPEP, with particular emphasis on host resistance to viral infection. Hsd:Harlan Sprague Dawley SD<sup>®</sup> rats were treated for 28 days by oral gavage with doses of 0, 62.5, 125, 250 or 500 mg/kg/day of MPEP in corn oil. There was a dose-dependent increase in liver weights which is consistent with the liver playing a dominant role in MPEP metabolism. However, no histological correlates were observed. Following treatment, rats were subjected to a battery of immune tests as well as an established rat model of influenza virus infection to provide a comprehensive assessment of immune function and host resistance. While several of the immune tests showed minor exposure-related changes, evidenced by negative dose-response trends, most did not show significant differences in any of the MPEP treatment groups relative to vehicle control. Most notable was a negative trend in pulmonary mononuclear cell phagocytosis with increases in dose of MPEP. There was also a positive trend in early humoral immune response (5 days after immunization) to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as evidenced by increased serum anti-KLH IgM antibodies which was followed later (14 days following immunization) by decreasing trends in anti-KLH IgM and IgG antibody levels. However, MPEP treatment had no effect on the ability of rats to clear the influenza virus nor the T-dependent IgM and IgG antibody response to the virus. The lack of effects of MPEP on host resistance to influenza suggests the immune effects were minimal and unlikely to present a hazard with respect to susceptibility to respiratory viral infection.",

The involvement of <i>Enterobacter</i> species is rare and typically linked to chronic or nosocomial infections. Typical cases of acute rhinosinusitis in children present with abundant nasal discharge, headache, and fever and are generally managed with systemic antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), mucolytics, and topical intranasal treatment. Atypical presentations prompt heightened clinical attention, and depending on the symptoms and patient status, surgical interventions might be considered. <b>Case Presentation</b>: We report the case of a previously healthy 5-year-old boy presenting with painful unilateral palpebral edema, minimal ipsilateral nasal discharge, and persistent headache despite standard rhinosinusitis therapy. Imaging tests revealed complete right maxillary sinus opacification. As the clinical response to ceftriaxone and dexamethasone was minimal, we opted for endoscopic sinus surgery.

        "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: Neonatal influenza is a rare condition. Young infants have immature immune defenses and are unable to receive direct vaccination; this can result in significant illness. Maternal anti-influenza immunization during pregnancy provides passive antibodies to the newborn via transplacental transfer, significantly decreasing the incidence and severity of influenza in early infancy. Nevertheless, the vaccination coverage during pregnancy remains low in many regions, leaving certain neonates without adequate protection. <b>Methods</b>: We present three cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection in neonates admitted to the \"Sf. Ioan\" Clinical Emergency Pediatric Hospital in Galați and conduct a literature review. The clinical presentation, co-infections, timing of antiviral therapy, laboratory findings, maternal vaccination status, and outcomes (including the hospitalization duration and recovery) were systematically analyzed for each case. <b>Results</b>: All three neonates were full-term and previously healthy, born to mothers who had not received influenza vaccinations during their pregnancies. They presented at ages ranging from 2 to 4 weeks with fever, respiratory symptoms including a cough, nasal congestion, and respiratory distress, as well as feeding difficulties. One case involved a co-infection with Bordetella pertussis, which manifested as a severe paroxysmal cough, cyanosis, and apnea. Laboratory findings in the cases with influenza alone indicated leukopenia accompanied by normal C-reactive protein levels. In the co-infection case, leukocytosis, lymphocytosis, and thrombocytosis were observed. All the infants received oseltamivir treatment within 48 h of the symptom onset; the case with pertussis co-infection also received azithromycin. Each infant required supplemental oxygen, but none necessitated mechanical ventilation. Clinical improvement was observed in all cases, with hospitalization ranging from 6 to 7 days and complete recovery without complications. <b>Conclusions</b>: Neonatal influenza may result in considerable morbidity, particularly in infants born to unvaccinated mothers. Positive outcomes, however, have been correlated with early diagnosis and antiviral treatment. Pertussis co-infection may exacerbate clinical progression, underscoring the importance of maternal immunization against both influenza and pertussis. In this case series, we aim to present three cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza in neonates born to mothers who were not immunized against influenza during pregnancy. These cases highlight the clinical presentations of neonatal influenza, underscore the risks associated with pertussis co-infection, and reinforce the importance of maternal influenza and Tdap vaccination for preventing severe outcomes in newborns.",

Emerging high pathogenic influenza strains from animals such as H5N1 and H7N9 further exacerbates pandemic risks. While developing effective vaccines and therapeutics is critical, the evaluation of these interventions is constrained by the requirement for high biosafety containment facilities. To circumvent these challenges, we developed S-Lux, a replication-deficient, single-cycle recombinant influenza virus expressing <i>firefly luciferase</i> (<i>Flux</i>) as a reporter protein. S-Lux can be pseudotyped with haemagglutinin from avian influenza, H5 and H7, enabling real-time monitoring of viral infection <i>in vivo</i>, and facilitate therapeutic antibody evaluation in low-containment facilities. In mice, S-Lux infection resulted in dose-dependent bioluminescent expression in the mouse airways and allowed evaluation of neutralising monoclonal antibodies and clearance of infected cells in mice. To extend this system, we generated ES-Lux by pseudotyping with the Ebola Glycoprotein (GP) and demonstrated that ES-Lux can be used to evaluate the efficacy of Ebola GP-targeting antibodies <i>in vivo</i>.

We determined the fraction of AFI attributable to influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in Ethiopia, along with an understanding of their epidemiological characteristics. From February 2021 to June 2022, we enrolled patients meeting an AFI case definition (age >5 years with fever ≥38°C) who presented at one of four selected sentinel hospital sites in Jimma, Harari, Addis Ababa, and Gonder. Clinical and epidemiological information was collected, Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected and analyzed using real-time PCR for respiratory viruses (influenza and SARS-CoV-2). A quasi-binomial regression model and multivariable regression were performed to compute fractions and establish associations with the agent detected. A total of 737 AFI cases were enrolled. The overall proportion of SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, and influenza B among AFI patients were 7.8, 1.9, and 0.5 per 100,000 population, respectively. Among the enrolled AFI cases tested for SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 was the most detected pathogen with a positivity rate of 13.7% (95% CI:11.3-16.4), followed by influenza A and influenza B, which have a positivity rate of 3.3% (95% CI: 2.2-5.1) and 0.8% (95% CI:0.3-1.8), respectively. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 peaked at 37.4% in September 2021. Per the multivariable analysis, cases ≥65 years of age were three [AOR = 3.3,95% CI:(1.9-5.7)] times more likely to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses were highly prevalent among AFI cases. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 was higher among older adults.

Here, we aimed to generate induced pulmonary epithelial-like cells in serum-containing culture (iPULsSC) using the same four transcription factors in a serum-containing 3D culture system. We found that the global gene expression profile of iPULsSC was similar to that of alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) and alveolar type I (AT1) cells. Surfactant protein (SP)-C-positive iPULsSC displayed lamellar body-like structures, consistent with the features of AT2 cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence that intratracheal administration of iPULsSC rescued influenza virus-induced acute lung injury in mice. These findings suggest that iPULsSC can provide a potential source of lung epithelial cells for regenerative medicine.

This questionnaire was aimed at all adults aged 18 and above. Both descriptive and regression analyses were performed. The study included 363 participants, revealing an influenza vaccination rate of only 9%. A significant correlation was found between manipulative, body-based methods, mind-body medicine, and vaccination status (P-value<0.05), while no significant relationship was noted with herbal remedies or alternative medical systems. Higher income and better health status were linked to increased vaccination likelihood (P-value<0.05), indicating a need for targeted public health campaigns. Although 63% of participants were familiar with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), 34% had never used it for influenza, highlighting a knowledge gap. Popular natural remedies like Vitamin C, ginger, and honey reflect a trend toward preventive healthcare despite concerns over costs and skepticism about CAM's effectiveness. Vaccine hesitancy is influenced by multiple factors, including context and types of CAM use. Cultural beliefs and personal health philosophies significantly shape attitudes toward CAM use and vaccination.",

        "abstract": "Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are a major cause of morbidity and lost workdays in both military and non-military populations. To better understand these infections and their outcomes, the Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Program has enabled nine major ARI clinical research protocols in the last decade, including observational studies and trials, spanning emerging and reemerging ARI threats including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, influenza, adenovirus, entero/rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and other pathogens. These protocols have resulted in epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data and biospecimens from over 26,000 participants, most of whom were beneficiaries of a geographically distributed Military Health System. The Acute Respiratory Infection Repository Protocol establishes a unique Department of Defense (DoD) research resource through the pooling of data and specimens from nine ARI protocols into a master, standardized database with a linked specimen repository. This will enable further targeted scientific questions in participant-level pooled meta-analyses and will serve as an on-demand repository for rapid assay development, sample size estimations for prospective studies, and observational study/clinical trial design (including as part of future rapid pandemic research response). Accordingly, the objectives and study design of this protocol are broad. This protocol will allow analyses on outcomes including: (i) short-term ARI outcomes such as hospitalization, work days lost, symptom severity and duration; (ii) post-acute ARI outcomes, including persistence of symptoms, return-to-health, post-ARI medical encounters; (iii) vaccine effectiveness for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), influenza, and adenovirus vaccines; (iv) ARI infection and vaccination elicited immune responses (humoral, T-cell, other); (v) therapeutic effectiveness of COVID-19 and influenza antivirals (acute symptoms, hospitalization, post-acute sequelae); (vi) effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masking) against infection; (vii) prognostic and mechanistic host viral biomarkers which correlate with the above outcomes; (viii) ARI diagnostic assay validity and performance. This repository protocol is inherently broad in scope; the collation of standardized data and phenotype-linked specimens is a fundamental, primary objective. This protocol will support statistical and laboratory analyses, including activities related to rapid epidemic response such as assay development and rapid sample size calculations for clinical trials. A series of more specific scientific questions from current and future collaborators will leverage this joint database and specimen repository; these questions will target important aspects of ARI infection, transmission, outcomes, and treatment. Future protocols (and ongoing data from existing IDCRP protocols) will be added to this collaborative repository protocol.",

        "title": "Shifts in Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection Patterns in Korea After the COVID-19 Pandemic Resulting From Immunity Debt: Retrospective Observational Study.",
        "abstract": "Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as mask-wearing and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the transmission of common respiratory viruses, including influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). As NPIs were stopped, concerns emerged about \"immunity debt,\" which suggests that limited natural exposure to pathogens may have increased susceptibility and severity, particularly among young children. However, despite growing attention, the postpandemic impact of NPIs on epidemiologic patterns and shifts in age-specific disease burden remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate, using national surveillance data, the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology and clinical burden of influenza virus and RSV infections in Korea, with an emphasis on the influence of NPIs on the incidence and clinical severity of these infections, particularly among young children. We analyzed weekly virologic, outpatient, and inpatient surveillance data on influenza virus and RSV infections from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency from 2017 to 2024, covering the prepandemic, pandemic, and postpandemic periods. Time-series analyses were conducted to examine changes in seasonality and to estimate age-specific incidence and clinical severity of influenza virus and RSV infections before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. In the postpandemic seasons, both RSV and influenza virus infections showed disrupted seasonality with delayed and prolonged epidemics. While the overall burden of both viruses was comparable to that for prepandemic periods, there was a notable shift in the age distribution of severe cases. Among influenza-associated hospital admissions, the proportion of school-aged children (7-18 years) doubled, rising from 14% (1,814/12,660) in 2019/20 to 28% (2,176/7,755) in 2022/23. Hospitalization rates in this age group also increased significantly, from 46.8 to 64.4 per 100,000 among children aged 7-12 years, and from 16.4 to 30.0 per 100,000 among those aged 13-18 years. For RSV infections, the burden shifted most prominently to young children aged 1-6 years, whose share of hospital admissions rose from 48% (5,789/11,969) to 61% (7,316/12,011) over the same period. This age group also experienced the largest rise in RSV-associated hospitalization rates, increasing from 230.8 to 357.5 per 100,000 between the 2019/20 and 2022/23 seasons. The patterns of influenza virus and RSV infections in Korea following the COVID-19 pandemic reveal distinct shifts in timing, severity, and the age groups that were most affected. Postpandemic influenza and RSV activity in Korea showed delayed and prolonged epidemics, with shifts in age-specific disease burden rather than an overall increase. Substantial increases in susceptibility and severity among young children for RSV infections and older children for influenza virus infections suggest lingering immunity gaps from reduced exposures during the pandemic. These effects may be further compounded by declining influenza vaccine uptake among children following the pandemic. Our findings underscore the importance of ongoing surveillance and targeted public health measures to manage respiratory viruses in the postpandemic era.",

        "title": "Phosphodiesterase Inhibition and Immunotropic Activity of Dipyridamole Dynamic Derivatives.",
        "abstract": "<i>Introduction.</i> Many pharmacological properties of dipyridamole (DIP) are associated with its ability to inhibit phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Actually, DIP has interesting properties like antiviral for influenza, SARS-2 COVID-19, and herpesviruses. Our research aimed to design and synthesize the dynamic combinatorial DIP derivatives with more pronounced inhibiting properties in relation to PDE and to carry out the HPLC analysis of the resulting combinatorial derivatives of DIP. This study is aimed at investigating the effect of the dynamic derivative of dipyridamole (DDD) on intestinal dysbiosis syndrome in mice caused by streptomycin against the background of cyclophosphamide-induced cellular immunodeficiency. <i>Materials and methods</i>. For the synthesis of a dynamic combinatorial derivative of dipyridamole, we used a molecular dynamic method for drug design and combinatorial acylation of dipyridamole by succinic and acetic anhydride in different molar ranges of acylation agents. Combinatorial derivatives were analyzed using gradient HPLC with a UV detector. Also, derivatives established the inhibition ability for phosphodiesterase by the spectrophotometric method. Also, we used an in vivo mouse model with immunodeficiency caused by cyclophosphamide for pharmacological study. <i>Results and discussion</i>. Molecular modeling suggests that 18 different dipyridamole derivatives can self-assemble into a stable supramolecular structure with lower total energy. Specific combinatorial molar ratios of the synthesis components were necessary to create a new supramolecular compound with enhanced pharmacological properties. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase in such a dynamic combinatorial derivative already appeared at a concentration of 0.05 μM. In mice with colitis caused by streptomycin treatment, the administration of DDD per os resulted in an antidiarrheal effect and prevention of the animals' weight loss. Given the cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression and streptomycin-associated diarrhea, immunity was completely restored only under the action of DDD. <i>Conclusions</i>. The most effective dipyridamole derivative for phosphodiesterase inhibition was formed only if the number of different derivatives in solution was maximum and consisted of all 18 molecules. With other quantities of modifiers, there was no qualitative change in the inhibitory activity of the combinatorial mixture against phosphodiesterase. According to all parameters, DDD has been proven to be more effective than the pure dipyridamole reference product.",

        "abstract": "Recurrent epidemics and pandemics caused by seasonal human influenza viruses result in substantial morbidity and are a significant public health burden worldwide annually. Antiviral drugs are used to treat influenza infections but have several limitations.. Therefore, monoclonal antibody therapy is an exciting and promising approach. Nanobodies, also known as single-domain antibodies, are a new class derived from heavy-chain-only antibodies found in camelids like alpacas, llamas, and camels. These antibodies neutralize influenza viruses by targeting various proteins through multiple mechanisms. For example, they can target the hemagglutinin protein to prevent its functions. By focusing on conserved epitopes, they can neutralize a variety of influenza subtypes, including seasonal flu strains and possible pandemic variants. Additionally, these antibodies can neutralize free-floating viruses in the extracellular environment, preventing them from infecting cells. They can reduce the viral load and limit the spread of the infection. Using nanobodies to neutralize influenza viruses provides numerous advantages compared to conventional antibodies. Thanks to their unique properties, nanobodies play a crucial role in fighting influenza, improving disease management, and strengthening public health responses. In this review, we summarize the role of nanobodies in influenza virus neutralization.",

        "abstract": "As a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)-originated antiviral prescription, Fufang Shuanghua oral liquid (FS) is extensively used for influenza virus therapy with a satisfying therapeutic efficacy in clinic. The bioactive compounds (BACs) and the molecular mechanisms of FS against influenza A virus (IAV)-infected acute lung injury were investigated. IAV-infected acute lung injury mouse model was established infected by IAV (H1N1) strain A/PR/8/34 to evaluate the pharmacological effects of FS. After both in vivo and in vitro chemical profiling using UHPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS/MS system, the clinical transcriptomic-based biomolecular network was analyzed to assess the key underlying mechanism of IAV infection. A series of in vivo experimental validations was carried out. Finally, an integrative research combining mapping network analysis, computational modeling and ADME models in silico was used for candidate BAC identification. Oral administration of FS exhibited prominent improvement in IAV-induced acute lung injury mice, such as reducing the lung viral load, slowing the rate of weight reduction, and ameliorating pathological alterations. After the therapeutic effects validation, a total of 106 chemical compounds were characterized, and subsequently 21 absorbed components in the mice sera samples were identified after intragastric administration of FS using the UHPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS/MS system, including 12 prototype compounds and 9 metabolites. Clinical transcriptomic-based networks indicated that TNF-mediated antiviral immune response may be key mechanism of IAV infection. A series of in vivo validations revealed that FS treatment effectively restored antiviral immunity by regulating the protein expression levels of TNF mediated IFN signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammatory signaling pathway, thereby downregulating the inflammatory factors/mediators, such as TNF-α, CXCL1, IL-18/6/1β, CCL-2/5/10, IFN-α/β/γ, OAS1/3, IRF1, and IFNB1. Finally, two bioactive candidates, including forsythoside A from LQ and chlorogenic acid from CXL, JYH, and LQ, were screened as the underlying representative BACs of FS for the strong binding affinities between target proteins and compounds, and good pharmacokinetic properties. FS exerts immunomodulatory effects through rebalancing antiviral homeostasis in influenza pathogenesis via suppressing the TNF-mediated IFN/NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The findings may decipher the polypharmacological nature of TCM interventions using systems pharmacology approaches.",

This study aimed to evaluate the microbial profile of airways in Indian children with CF and to generate antibiotic sensitivity patterns. Children ≤ 18 years old with newly diagnosed CF (Clinical and two positive sweat chloride tests) were included. The respiratory samples were collected at enrollment, follow-up (FU), and during pulmonary exacerbation. Three hundred and thirteen children were enrolled with a median (IQR) age of 2.8 (0.6, 8) years; 197 (62.9%) were boys. 530 microbiological samples were collected during the study period.

        "abstract": "The productive infection of influenza A virus (IAV) requires the functional involvement of host long noncoding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs). Identification of key cellular lncRNAs and elucidation of their molecular mechanisms in IAV replication are expected to expand our understanding of virus-host interactions and develop antiviral therapeutics. Our previous work has identified that influenza virus polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1)-associated long noncoding RNA (IPAN) associates with and stabilizes viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase PB1 of IAV, warranting efficient viral RNA synthesis. This provides a unique viral strategy of co-opting host lncRNA for replication, whereas the molecular pathways exploited by the virus are unknown. Here, we aim to further investigate the detailed mechanisms underlying IPAN-mediated PB1 stabilization. We employed cellular-level molecular interaction techniques to demonstrate that both retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) interacted with PB1 and co-operated to induce its degradation triggered by viral RNA synthesis. The experimental data obtained from RIG-I knockout cell lines and mutational analyses demonstrated RIG-I promoted PB1 degradation independently of its canonical signaling pathway, suggesting an \"effector-like\" antiviral activity of RIG-I. Furthermore, IPAN knockdown enhanced the association of PB1 with both RIG-I and TRIM25 to restore PB1 stability. These results collectively demonstrated that IAV hijacked host IPAN to protect PB1 from RIG-I/TRIM25-mediated antiviral degradation. Thus, our data reveal a mechanism of RIG-I and TRIM25 against IAV infection by degrading PB1 and highlight how IAV exploits host lncRNAs to evade immune surveillance.",

In this study, we found that replacing the hemagglutinin (HA) precursor sequence of H9N2 AIV (avian influenza virus) with that from H7N9 AIV significantly improved HA protein expression. Building on this, we combined the H9N2 HA leader sequence with a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) signal peptide and delayed lysis Salmonella mRNA interferase regulation vector (SIRV) system previously developed by our team. This novel approach markedly enhanced the expression of viral antigens delivered by Salmonella vectors. Our results demonstrate that both the H9N2 HA leader sequence and the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) signal peptide significantly increased H7N9 AIV HA protein expression and substantially improved the protective efficacy of the attenuated S.

Of the patients recommended for screening based on the presence of risk factors, 76.1% had an eGFR performed within the last 18 months, whilst 34.2% had an ACR performed in the same period. Rates of monitoring of patients with CKD were slightly higher. A blood pressure had been recorded within the last 9 months in 71.1% of patients with CKD, and in 75.6% of the subset of patients with both diabetes and albuminuria. Around 45% of all patients with CKD were meeting their blood pressure targets at their last recording. The results of this study demonstrate that it is feasible to derive meaningful and informative indicators of CKD diagnosis and management from primary care EMR data in Australia, which are comparable with international data. The low rates of CKD documentation and pathology monitoring provide opportunities for quality improvement initiatives to reduce disease burden. Not applicable.",

        "title": "A systematic scoping review and thematic analysis: How can livestock and poultry movement networks inform disease surveillance and control at the global scale?",
        "abstract": "The increasing threat of emerging infectious diseases affecting animal and human populations has prompted closer investigation into how movement-linked interactions contribute to geographic spread of pathogens. Animal movements are a key factor in the spread of diseases like Foot-and-Mouth-Disease and Avian Influenza. Network analysis of animal movement data has become a powerful tool for identifying transmission dynamics and informing disease control. However, a systematic evaluation of its applications across species is lacking. This study addresses this knowledge gap through a systematic evaluation of existing evidence. A modified scoping review was conducted following PRISMA-ScR guidelines and a Population, Index test, and Target condition research structure. Articles published between 1975 and 2024 were retrieved from six databases. Inclusion criteria focused on network analysis research explicitly mentioning livestock and poultry movements. Quantitative analyses in R and thematic analysis in NVIVO provided insights into key network applications. Our review of 203 studies across 52 countries highlighted a steady rise in network-based approaches since 2006, particularly after the 2001 Foot-and-Mouth-Disease outbreak. Cattle (40.3%) were the most studied species, followed by swine (33.2%) and poultry (13.0%). Five themes emerged: network structure, epidemic modeling, targeted control, outbreak analysis, and network inference. These applications demonstrated the flexibility of network analysis in veterinary epidemiology. However, challenges persist due to data accessibility, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Limited standardized movement data hinder cross-country comparisons and epidemiological insights. Expanding data collection, incorporating weighted connections, and integrating economic and geographic factors could enhance network-techniques. In conclusion, network analysis is a powerful framework for identifying high-risk nodes and designing targeted interventions. Future efforts must improve data standardization, temporal movement dynamics, and incorporate multiple transmission pathways to fully capture the complexity of movement networks and their role in pathogen spread. Moreover, strengthening industry-academic collaborations is crucial for optimizing network-based strategies.",

        "abstract": "Fa vipiravir (FAV), an antiviral for influenza and COVID-19, can provoke hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Curcumin (CUR) has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may protect against FAV-induced toxicity. Despite the widespread clinical use of FAV, to our knowledge, no in vivo animal study has yet examined its organ-specific oxidative injury profile in parallel with the putative dual, organ-directed actions of CUR. This study evaluated whether curcumin can mitigate favipiravir-induced oxidative and apoptotic damage in rat liver and kidney. Male Wistar rats received FAV (100 mg/kg i.p.) and CUR (100 or 200 mg/kg p.o.) for 14 days. Serum biochemistry analysis was performed to assess levels of ALT, AST, IL-6, MDA, TNF-α, and GSH. Additionally, histopathological examination and TUNEL assay were conducted on kidney and liver tissues. ALT, AST, and cytokines did not differ among groups. MDA remained unchanged in the FAV-alone group but rose significantly with CUR co-treatment, signifying CUR-driven amplification of oxidative stress, especially in hepatic tissue. Histopathological analysis revealed liver and kidney damage from FAV, with CUR exacerbating liver damage but offering partial protection to kidney structures. The TUNEL assay showed reduced apoptosis in the kidneys with CUR, especially at higher doses. FAV causes sub-clinical liver and kidney injury that is not accompanied by lipid peroxidation or enzyme leakage at 14 days. CUR exerts dual actions-mitigating renal apoptosis yet amplifying hepatic lipid peroxidation-highlighting an organ-specific risk-benefit ratio that should be weighed before empirical antioxidant supplementation during FAV therapy.",

This study aims to explore the role of airflow in mechanically ventilated environments in modulating airway immune and defense mechanisms. Based on the self-developed mouse-applicable climate chamber system and the corresponding mouse model, this study investigated the health effects of exposure to thermal environments [(I) 20 ℃, 0 m/s; (II) 20 ℃, 1.5 m/s; and (III) 15 ℃, 1.5 m/s] on influenza-infected mice (female, 6-8 weeks), of which body and organ weight, and survival situation were measured and recorded. Lung histopathologic changes were analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. The messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) relative expression levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in lung tissues were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Lung tissue virus titer measurement was also conducted. We also collected peripheral blood samples for blood cell counts to assess the impact of environmental conditions on systemic inflammation. Prolonged mild exposure to cold airflow inhibited weight gain and significantly increased lung coefficient. The relative mRNA expression of inflammatory factors in lung tissues was elevated considerably and the area occupied proportion of the lung interstitium was significantly increased after cold airflow exposure. However, peripheral blood neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages were not significantly different from those of the control group. While there were remarkable differences in body weight changes, survival situations, lung coefficients, lung tissue viral titers, and peripheral blood neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages for mice with different environmental exposure experiences after viral infection. Our findings suggest that the effects of airflow on health do not exist independently of temperature. Prolonged mild cold airflow in air-conditioned environments may induce respiratory injury and thus exacerbate respiratory virus infection outcomes, suggesting that the effect of airflow in air-conditioned environments should receive due attention in protecting public respiratory health.",

        "abstract": "Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure increases the frequency and severity of respiratory influenza A virus (IAV) infections in humans and increases mortality in mice. There is evidence that Cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1 (CYP1B1) enhances lung injury during hyperoxic exposure in animal models. We used an <i>in-vivo</i> mouse model to assess the hypothesis that CYP1B1 modifies innate immune responses to CS and alters survival during IAV infection. We measured CYP1B1 induction in bronchial epithelial cells in smokers and nonsmokers obtained by bronchoscopy by whole transcriptome analysis. To determine whether CYP1B1 knockout (CYP KO) improves mortality and reduces lung injury in CS-exposed mice, we compared the survival rates, host immune responses, and lung-to-body weight ratio of CYP KO mice with the wild-type (WT) mice following challenge with IAV with or without CS exposure. CYP1B1 is one of the most highly upregulated genes in human lung epithelia derived from cigarette smokers. In CS-exposed mice, CYP1B1 knockout (CYP KO) significantly increased survival during IAV infection. In both nonsmoking (NS) and CS mice, CYP KO significantly enhanced IAV-induced increases in total immune cell numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) without causing additional lung injury. CYP KO caused a more rapid IFN-γ response to IAV infection in lungs from both NS- and CS-exposed mice. Specifically, we found that IFN-γ was significantly increased in BALF and in the lung at day 5 post-infection (p.i.) in these mice. Flow cytometry showed that innate lymphocytes produced early IFN-γ in the lungs of KO mice. We confirmed the importance of IFN-γ for CYP KO survival by adding IFN-γ antibody to IAV-infected CYP KO mice. IFN-γ antibody treatment of CS-exposed CYP KO mice completely abolished the improved survival rate seen in KO mice without IFN-γ antibody treatment. However, IFN-γ administration to CS-exposed WT mice did not increase survival rates as seen in CS-exposed CYP KO mice after IAV infection. Our results demonstrate that CYP KO in mice protects against CS-enhanced susceptibility of smokers during influenza infection. IFN-γ is required but not sufficient for the protection of CS-exposed CYP KO mice against lethal IAV infection.",

        "abstract": "China implemented strict prevention and control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to prolonged home confinement of children and significantly reduced exposure to respiratory pathogens. The ability of children under these conditions to resist respiratory pathogens post-lifting of containment measures remained unknown. The children's ability to face respiratory pathogens post-isolation was assessed through collecting respiratory pathogens detection data, statistical analysis and comparing with pre-epidemic data. In this way, we addressed data gaps in related fields and provided empirical support for research and public health sectors. The pathogen detection method was real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Data analysis software: SPSS Statistics 23. Four environmental factors-temperature, humidity, wind speed and sunshine time-exerted interactive effects ton respiratory pathogens prevalence. Influenza A and B viruses, <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> and adenovirus exhibited seasonally prevalent patterns in winter, while respiratory syncytial virus showed lower prevalence in summer, and rhinovirus had no significant seasonal variation. The infection rate of respiratory syncytial virus and the number of expected infections decreased with the increase of age, whereas adenovirus, influenza virus, <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> and bacterial pathogens showed age-related increases in both metrics. Gender-related differences were observed in higher infection rates of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> in men compared to women. Co-infection analysis revealed that respiratory syncytial virus exhibited the highest co-infection diversity, followed by influenza B virus, <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> showed inhibition of co-infection with <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>. <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> had been shown to inhibit co-infection with <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>. The lower respiratory tract infection rate of <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> and bacterial pathogens exceeded the overall infection rate. Infection rates of influenza B virus and adenovirus were lower than the overall rate, while those of influenza A and rhinovirus paralleled the overall rate. Analysis of statistical data from China and Gansu Provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that most respiratory pathogens showed an increase in the infection rates post-COVID-19, particularly respiratory syncytial virus, indicating altered prevalence patterns in children due to prolonged exposure to isolated pathogens.",

        "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threatened public health and placed a significant burden on medical resources. The Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study collected clinical, demographic, blood cytometry, serum receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody titers, metabolomics, targeted proteomics, nasal metagenomics, Olink, nasal viral load, autoantibody, SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers, and nasal and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptomics data from patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The aim of this study is to select baseline biomarkers and build predictive models for 28-day in-hospital COVID-19 severity and mortality with most predictive variables while prioritizing routinely collected variables. We analyzed 1102 hospitalized COVID-19 participants. We used the lasso and forward selection to select top predictors for severity and mortality, and built predictive models based on balanced training data. We then validated the models on testing data. Severity was best predicted by the baseline SpO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio obtained from COVID-19 patients (test AUC: 0.874). Adding patient age, BMI, FGF23, IL-6, and LTA to the disease severity prediction model improves the test AUC by an additional 3%. The clinical mortality prediction model using SpO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio, age, and BMI resulted in a test AUC of 0.83. Adding laboratory results such as TNFRSF11B and plasma ribitol count increased the prediction model by 3.5%. The severity and mortality prediction models developed outperform the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score among inpatients and perform similarly to the SOFA score among ICU patients. This study identifies clinical data and laboratory biomarkers of COVID-19 severity and mortality using machine learning models. The study identifies SpO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio to be the most important predictor for both severity and mortality. Several biomarkers were identified to modestly improve the predictions. The results also provide a baseline of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the early stages of the coronavirus emergence and can serve as a baseline for future studies that inform how the genetic evolution of the coronavirus affects the host response to new variants.",

        "abstract": "Immunosuppression in patients with cancer increases susceptibility to vaccine-preventable diseases, with suboptimal vaccination rates attributed to complex treatment schedules, timing of vaccination and uncertainty in relation to vaccination effectiveness. While pharmacists are routinely vaccinating patients in the community, high-risk cohorts, such as oncology patients, often lack access to dedicated vaccine services in hospital outpatient settings. Pharmacist-led vaccination clinics offer a promising solution to overcome existing barriers by integrating accessible, trusted healthcare professionals into patients' treatment location, to improve uptake through timely, co-located, and coordinated care. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of healthcare professionals regarding the implementation of a pharmacist-led vaccine clinic in an outpatient oncology unit. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with pharmacists, nurses, and doctors from a single site regional referral hospital. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, deductively and inductively coded and thematically analysed, with emerging themes mapped to the constructs of the Diffusion of Innovation Theory: relative advantage, complexity, compatibility, observability and trialability. Nineteen interviews were conducted with healthcare professionals, including seven pharmacists, six nurses and six doctors. Factors identified for successful implementation of a pharmacist-led vaccination clinic included patient-centred models, improved convenience and reduced complexity for patients, and compatibility with pharmacists' existing knowledge and role in outpatient units. Barriers were found to be work overload for pharmacists, reduced interaction with general practitioners, and lack of understanding of pharmacists' vaccination training. Healthcare professionals expressed strong support for a pharmacist-led vaccine clinic in an outpatient oncology unit, recognising the potential to improve vaccination rates. Future research should however focus on assessing patient acceptance of such a service and the impact of such a clinic on vaccination rates.",

Our study aimed to utilize publicly available transcriptomic respiratory viral datasets of rhinovirus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and COVID-19 to understand their autoimmune activation. Antibodies produced against the autoantigens associated with respiratory viruses resulted in the identification of three biomarker genes: <i>TRIM21, ELANE,</i> and <i>CTSG</i>. These genes are reported to be involved in the pathways of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, apoptosis, amebiasis, renin-angiotensin system, and lysosome, commonly triggering the systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathway in genetically susceptible SLE patients. These results emphasize that the key genes are enriched mainly in the immune system process linking SLE pathogenesis. Literature sources suggest that the biomarkers induce autoreactivity through bystander activation and molecular mimicry which results in aberrant B-cell activation and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps leading to autoimmunity. Thus, these key biomarkers indicate a new direction for early diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment of respiratory virus infections and SLE pathogenesis.",

Clinical data were collected at the first visit; diary cards were maintained for up to 8 days. Clinical specimens were collected twice, with a median interval of 4 days. PA substitutions were screened by real-time RT-PCR and confirmed by next-generation sequencing and Sanger methods. Among 247 patients, 24 (9.7%) harbored PA variants, one pre-treatment and 23 post-treatment. PA/I38T was the most common substitution. A(H3N2) patients had a higher frequency of PA variants than A(H1N1)pdm09 (13.8% vs. 5.1%). Although PA variants were associated with slower viral RNA decline, no significant differences were observed in fever duration (median 22.6 vs. 15.6 h) or symptom duration (median 105.0 vs. 113.3 h) compared to wild-type virus infections. PA variants, especially PA/I38T, emerged more frequently in A(H3N2) infections but had minimal clinical impact. The rarity of pre-treatment variants supports limited community transmission.

        "abstract": "Respiratory infections such as pneumococcal disease (PD), RSV, influenza (flu), and COVID-19 impose a major socio-economic burden in the UK. Adult vaccination programs cost-effectively reduce this burden, yet their societal value remains under-assessed. A benefit-cost analysis (BCA) using life-table-based disease modeling estimated morbidity and mortality reductions from current age- and risk-based recommendations. Mortality risk reduction was monetized using two approaches: value of a statistical life year (VSLY) and hence adjusting for remaining life expectancy, and value of a statistical life (VSL), assuming equal valuation across ages. Scenarios included current and expanded eligibility. Outcomes were reported as benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) and net benefits (NBs). Over each cohort's lifetime, vaccinations prevented 313,000 hospitalizations, freed up 1.9 million bed days, and averted over 86,000 deaths. First-year BCRs were 5.1 (VSLY) and 19.3 (VSL), with NBs of £5.1 billion and £23 billion, respectively. Lifetime net benefits ranged from £35.5 billion to £200.1 billion, with BCRs of 5.8 and 27.8.

        "abstract": "Respiratory infections like pneumococcal disease (PD), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza (Flu), and COVID-19 significantly impact Japan's aging population, imposing substantial health and economic burdens. Effective vaccines exist, yet uptake remains limited due to funding constraints and vaccine hesitancy. This study assessed the societal return on investment in adult respiratory vaccination programs to support informed policy decisions. We conducted a benefit-cost analysis using static cohort models and life tables to estimate benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) and societal net benefits (NBs), monetizing health impacts through the value of statistical life and cost-of-illness methods. Costs comprised vaccination program expenses. Scenario and sensitivity analyses explore coverage scenarios and parameter assumptions. Adult vaccination programs generated BCRs around 18:1 within 5 years and 20:1 over a lifetime. Lifetime NBs exceeded ¥113 trillion, preventing nearly three million hospitalizations and freeing millions of hospital bed-days, alongside avoiding over ¥100 billion in productivity losses. Expanding vaccine coverage significantly increased the NBs by > 30%, whereas reduced COVID-19 vaccine uptake notably diminished returns. Japan's adult respiratory vaccination programs generate substantial socioeconomic returns, strengthening public health, healthcare resilience, and workforce productivity. Increasing uptake across the population can generate significantly higher NBs. Realizing these benefits requires addressing vaccine uptake barriers and enhancing public investment.",

        "abstract": "Respiratory infections are a major cause of mortality among young children and adults, particularly the elderly or those with underlying medical conditions. Many respiratory infections, including influenza, COVID-19, pneumococcal disease, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), have available vaccines and antiviral agents. However, vaccine coverage rates remain low. Experts representing a broad spectrum of medical specialties from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) made evidence-based recommendations on treating patients considered high risk for respiratory infections, highlighting gaps in current practices and suggesting strategies for improved communication between healthcare professionals and patients. To effectively manage respiratory infections, the experts emphasized the importance of adhering to guidelines, considering all vaccines and antiviral treatments, and strictly following vaccination schedules. Early testing upon recognition of symptoms was also encouraged. Improving vaccine uptake was considered crucial and could be achieved by educating patients about disease prevention through vaccines and the role of antiviral treatments for COVID-19. Addressing knowledge gaps and combating vaccine hesitancy among both patients and healthcare professionals were also essential steps. Recommendations for future initiatives include healthcare professionals educating the public on precautionary measures to reduce the spread of respiratory infections. Additionally, the experts agreed that clinical management guidelines for chronic diseases should be updated to include preventative strategies such as vaccines, prophylaxis, and counselling. Monitoring the performance of healthcare facilities using key performance indicators is also recommended to ensure effective management and continuous improvement of vaccination programs. Patient populations in the UAE who are considered at high risk of serious disease from respiratory infections have diverse medical needs and may access healthcare across a wide range of settings and specialisms. Therefore, it is vital that all healthcare professionals across specialisms who may engage with these individuals are able to provide appropriate advice on managing the risk through vaccination, prompt testing, and treatments as needed.",

        "abstract": "The recent spillover events of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b to dairy cattle, and high viral shedding in the milk from infected animals, has created concern that milk and dairy products could be a route for human infection. It has been demonstrated that pasteurization is effective in inactivating A(H5N1) in milk. However, multiple dairy products are made with unpasteurized but thermised milk. Thermisation is a subpasteurisation heat treatment applied to raw milk, and the aim of this study was to examine whether commonly used conditions for thermisation are effective against inactivation of A(H5N1) in whole milk. For this purpose, we artificially inoculated whole raw cow milk with 6.5 log<sub>10</sub> EID<sub>50</sub> A(H5N1) and heated for 15 s at 60, 63 and 66 °C, the viral infectivity was tested using embryonated chicken eggs. We observed over 4 and 5 log reduction in viral infectivity at 60 and 63 °C, respectively (p < 0.0001) compared to the titre in untreated milk. The viral infectivity was reduced to below the detection limit at 66 °C. We also calculated the D-values, the time required to reduce the viral titer by one log, for each treatment and as expected, we observed a decrease in D-values with increasing thermisation temperature. These data demonstrate that thermisation is effective in reducing the viral load and thus they allow for informed risk assessment of A(H5N1) contaminated dairy products made from thermized milk.",

        "abstract": "To what extent a care pathway, due to its associated pollution, may be more detrimental to future health than beneficial to contemporary patients is still an open question. We present a methodological framework to integrate pollutant-induced future health damages in health technology assessment (HTA) metrics like quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for a better evaluation of the cost effectiveness of care pathways. We used the ReCiPe model to estimate the future detrimental health impact (in disability-adjusted life years [DALY]) of pollutants from the US healthcare system, showing the major impact of GHG emissions compared with other pollutants. An adapted version of the ReCiPe model was used to convert GHG emissions from care pathways into future DALY<sub>GHG</sub>, QALY<sub>GHG</sub>, and life years (LY<sub>GHG</sub>), as well as the associated confidence intervals. For a given care pathway, future health damages were compared with patient benefits (e.g., QALY<sub>GHG</sub>/QALY<sub>patient</sub>). Damages may also be integrated in the ICER<sub>GHG</sub> by subtracting future health losses from patient health benefits. Case applications are provided. Future damages to health emerging from pollutants emitted by the US healthcare system were estimated at 7,363,000 DALYs per year. Focusing on GHG emissions to estimate pollutant impact is reasonable, as they represent >90% of future damages. We provide estimates to convert GHG emissions into future health damages in DALY, QALY, or LY (and associated uncertainty), taking into account future impacts over different time horizons (20, 100, or 500-1000 years) and using different discount rates for future health impact (0 or 3%). We recommend estimating future damages using an egalitarian perspective (with a 0% discount rate) to maintain intergenerational equity. The QALY<sub>GHG</sub>/QALY<sub>patient</sub> ratio allows weighting future detrimental effects of care pathways against their benefits. For health economic evaluations, we recommend integrating GHG emissions into the ICER, preferably in its denominator (QALY, DALY, LY). When focusing on specific care pathways, health gains may be substantially limited by future GHG-related detrimental impacts, especially for chronic treatments in low-risk populations. Some care pathways, like influenza vaccination, improve patient health while mitigating GHG. Accounting for GHG emissions may substantially favor or penalize one strategy over another in terms of ICER. Confidence intervals of the results were wide due to large uncertainties regarding long-term predictions. HTA should consider care pathways' impact on future health to better assess the impact and cost effectiveness of health technologies. Under the hypothesis of intergenerational equity, GHG accounting has a substantial impact, and may presumably impact the decisions of HTA bodies. It may also be seen as an ecological bonus/malus for care pathway developers and pharmaceutical companies, incentivizing the development of greener care pathways. None.",

        "abstract": "The H5 subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) pose a major threat to wild fowl and poultry. Additionally, they can overcome the species barrier, inducing human infection, which may become fatal. Thus, the H5 subtype AIVs remain a global public health burden, with a huge pandemic potential. Therefore, it is imperative to establish a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for detecting H5 subtype AIV infection for diagnostic and preventive purposes. The quantum dot fluorescent microsphere-based immunochromatographic strip (QDFM-ICS) is being widely used for detecting various viruses. We here developed a pair of monoclonal antibodies (2F2 and 2B7) by immunizing mice with the A/duck/Zhejiang/6D2/2013(H5N6) virus and covalently linking them with quantum dots to generate a QDFM-ICS for detecting H5 subtype AIVs. The QDFM-ICS showed a limit of detection of 0.0625 hemagglutination units (HAU) per 80 µL for live H5 subtype AIVs and 1.2 ng/mL purified H5N6 hemagglutination protein, respectively. In addition, it demonstrated good reproducibility with a coefficient of variation of < 10%, showing a high degree of repeatability. The strips exhibited a full percentage of specificity. Notably, their sensitivity and specificity remained unaffected even when stored for 3 months at room temperature or 4 °C. Furthermore, the application in practical testing on field samples demonstrated a strong correlation between QDFM-ICS and real-time PCR. The QDFM-ICS can be used in less time, with a simpler operation, and lesser expenditure. Thus, QDFM-ICS is a practical and promising technique for detecting H5 subtype AIVs, especially in point-of-care testing.",

        "abstract": "After experiencing the global COVID-19 pandemic, whether there have been new changes in the epidemiological characteristics of influenza has become a topic of great concern. This study aims to investigate the impact of implementation and lifting of COVID-19 control measures on influenza positivity among patients with acute respiratory infections (ARI) from 2018 to 2023. The data were collected from January 2018 to December 2023 in two designated sentinel hospitals in Jinhua. We performed an interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) using a beta regression model and a generalized additive model (GAM), adopting a two-model cross-validation strategy to assess the effect of two major interventions on influenza positivity: the COVID-19 control measures implemented in early 2020 and lifted at the end of 2022. We also analyzed influenza epidemiological characteristics and seasonality before, during, and after the pandemic. A total of 98,244 cases were included in this study, and the overall influenza positivity rate was 39.34%. Females and the 6-17-year age group had higher positivity rates. Before the pandemic, influenza primarily showed a winter peak pattern, whereas during the pandemic, the positivity rate declined significantly with no distinct peak. After the pandemic ended, an unusual dual-peak pattern emerged. The interrupted time series analysis revealed that, following the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in early 2020, influenza positivity immediately decreased significantly in the beta regression model (β = -1.75, p = 0.003). After the lifting of measures in late 2022, a marginally lagged increasing trend was observed in the beta regression model (β = 0.14, p = 0.096) and a significant increasing trend was found in the GAM model (edf = 7.00, p < 0.001). Seasonal effects differed between the models: the beta regression model exhibited significant annual seasonal fluctuations (sin12 = 0.67, p < 0.001), while the GAM model did not exhibit a significant association independent of the time trend. COVID-19 and its control measures substantially reduced influenza positivity rates; however, once these measures were lifted, influenza activity resurged, and its seasonal epidemic pattern changed. The intensity of influenza appeared to exceed pre-pandemic levels, underscoring the importance of NPIs in controlling respiratory infectious diseases. Strengthened surveillance and optimized strategies remain necessary to mitigate the threat of influenza in the post-pandemic era.",

This study evaluates the prevalence, clinical profiles, and outcomes of C. albicans-associated respiratory infections in this population. From April 2021 to December 2024, 10,310 pediatric inpatients with respiratory infections at Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Maternal and Child Health Hospital underwent pathogen screening via targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS). C. albicans was detected in 5.0% (511/10,310), with detection rates varying by specimen: highest in sputum (10.3%), followed by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (8.8%), and minimal in throat swabs (0.3%). Co-infections occurred in 99.0% (506/511), predominantly involving Mycoplasma pneumoniae (189), Haemophilus influenzae (174), and Rhinovirus (169). ICU patients (6.3%) demonstrated elevated inflammatory markers (PCT: 0.31 vs. 0.08 ng/mL; D-dimer: 795 vs. 360 ng/mL FEU; P < 0.001), prolonged hospitalization (median 17 vs. 7 days, P < 0.001), and distinct pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii vs. M. pneumoniae in non-ICU). 51.7% and 35.4% of the children experienced respiratory and other systemic complications, respectively. Among the 511 children diagnosed with C. albicans infection, 32 (6.3%) required ICU admission for monitoring. The median duration of hospitalization for these 511 children was 7 days. Of these, 482 (94.3%) recovered and were discharged following treatment, while 26 (5.0%) had family members who requested voluntary discharge due to unsatisfactory outcomes or other reasons. Unfortunately, 3 children (0.6%) died despite receiving intensive medical treatment. This large-scale tNGS-based study addresses critical knowledge gaps, revealing ICU-specific pathogen profiles (A. baumannii), high co-infection burdens (99.0%), and complications linked to prematurity/immunodeficiency. The predominance of lower respiratory tract involvement (sputum/BALF positivity) underscores the need for specimen-selective diagnostics. Findings advocate for optimized tNGS protocols, ICU-tailored antimicrobial strategies, and early interventions in high-risk subgroups to reduce morbidity (e.g., sepsis risk) and socioeconomic burdens.",

In this study, air sampling was conducted from January to March 2023 in two outpatient medical clinics-one primary care clinic and one clinic dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory illnesses-for the purpose of assessing airborne respiratory virus presence. Work involved the operation of a BioSpot-VIVAS<sup>™</sup> as a stationary air sampler and deployment of NIOSH BC-251 bioaerosol samplers as either stationary devices or personal air samplers worn by staff members. Results were correlated with deidentified clinical data from patient testing. Samples from seven days were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, and influenza B Victoria- and Yamagata-lineage viruses, with an overall 17.5% (17/97) positivity rate. Airborne viruses predominated in particles of aerodynamic diameters from 1-4 μm and were recovered in similar quantities from both clinics. BC-251 samplers (17.4%, 15/86) and VIVAS (18.2%, 2/11) collected detectable viruses at similar rates, but more numerous BC-251 samplers provided greater insight into virus presence across clinical spaces and job categories. 60% of samples from reception areas contained detectable virus, and exposure to significantly more virus (p = 0.0028) occurred at reception desks as compared to the \"mobile\" job categories of medical providers and nurses. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the impacts of hazard mitigation controls tailored to reducing respiratory virus exposure and highlights the need for continued diligence toward exposure risk mitigation in outpatient medical clinics.",
