        "title": "Symptomatic Mycoplasma genitalium infections in men who have sex with men and trans women: Should we skip macrolides?",
        "abstract": "Mycoplasma genitalium is an emerging sexually transmitted infection (STI) with increasing antimicrobial resistance, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). This study aimed to evaluate the incidence, clinical characteristics, and antibiotic resistance patterns of M. genitalium among symptomatic MSM and transgender women (TGW) attending a specialized STI clinic in Barcelona, Spain. A retrospective observational study was conducted between January and December 2024. Symptomatic MSM and TGW patients diagnosed with M. genitalium through nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) were included. Macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance mutations were detected using real-time PCR assays. Patients were treated according to European guidelines, with resistance-guided therapy. Among 71 patients with M. genitalium infection, 53.5 % presented with urethritis and 42.3 % with proctitis. Coinfection with other STIs was detected in 35 %, and 29.5 % had a history of recent STI. Alarmingly, 85.9 % of patients carried azithromycin resistance-associated mutations, while 42.3 % showed dual resistance to azithromycin and moxifloxacin. A test of cure (TOC) was performed in 26 patients (36.6 %), with 23.1 % (6/26) of them remaining positive, mainly due to dual resistance. The remaining 45 patients were lost to follow-up, but no relapses were recorded in six months CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. genitalium among MSM underscores the need for alternative first-line therapeutic strategies, particularly in settings with limited access to resistance testing. Further research is required to optimize treatment regimens and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routine macrolide susceptibility testing in high-risk populations.",

        "title": "Antibiotic Use in Livestock and Environmental Antibiotic Resistance: A Narrative Review.",
        "abstract": "Antimicrobial use in animal husbandry is a common practice in developing countries as a response to the growing demand for animal-based foods. Veterinary antibiotics account for most of the antibiotics used worldwide. This review aims to provide an overview of the impact of antibiotic usage in livestock production on the environment and its consequences in the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. The global estimate of antibiotic consumption in animals ranges from 63 000 to 106 000 tons annually. The most commonly used antibiotic classes include tetracyclines, sulfonamides, β-lactams, macrolides, and trimethoprim. Most of the antibiotics used in animal treatments are not fully metabolized within the animal's body; instead, they are excreted and can enter the environment. This review also provides a brief overview of the fate of antibiotic residues and their behavior in the environment. In developing countries, in addition to the lack of data on antibiotic use trends, there are limitations in implementing scientific and regulatory frameworks for antibiotic use in livestock. To reduce the projected loss of lives associated with antimicrobial resistant infections, it is recommended to lower antibiotic contamination in the environment by implementing affordable and critical actions related to antibiotic usage and residual waste management. Actions such as rational use of antibiotics in all circumstances, reducing environmental exposure to antibiotics, research, and environmental surveillance are important to tackle the problems of antibiotic resistance, especially in low-income countries.",

        "title": "[Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis-The new German S3 guideline].",
        "abstract": "Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is a relatively new movement in Germany that aims to rationalize the use of antibiotics. The primary aim is to halt the global rise of bacterial resistance which of course also affects Germany. Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is an important topic for AMS. In December 2024 the new S3 guideline on perioperative prophylaxis was published by the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF), which are also presented here.Surgical site infections (SSI) have greatly increased in Germany in recent years. These should be prevented with perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Nevertheless, for AMS reasons, the antibiotic prescription of perioperative prophylaxis should be judicious. As many studies have shown, the optimal time for administering antibiotics is 30-60 min before the surgical incision. This interval ensures an adequate antibiotic concentration in skin and subcutaneous tissue. A history of penicillin allergy should be preoperatively questioned as only a small proportion of patients who report a penicillin allergy actually have one; however, beta-lactams are the most important substances for perioperative prophylaxis, alternative substances such as clindamycin are less effective and resistance rates have greatly increased. Multidrug-resistant pathogens (MRE) are now given special consideration: the new guideline lists surgical procedures where MRE should be considered as well as the recommended screening and adjustment of substance selection in this situation. The most important point from the perspective of infectious diseases, however, is the duration of the perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis: it is specified also in the new guidelines (with a few exceptions) as a single dose (plus intraoperative re-dosing in the event of a long duration of surgery or high intraoperative blood loss).The new guidelines excellently summarize the existing data and based on these provide clear recommendations. It thus supports AMS efforts in this area in an exemplary manner.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background</b>: <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> causes Buruli ulcer (BU), a necrotizing skin disease endemic in over 30 countries. Its toxin, mycolactone, drives tissue destruction, and the infection is transmitted via environmental reservoirs or vectors. Disease patterns vary globally, and an improved understanding of their pathogenesis may enhance current antimicrobial and surgical treatments. <b>Methods</b>: A comprehensive literature search from 1901 to 2025 was conducted across major databases to explore antimicrobial and reconstructive surgical strategies for <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i>. Search terms included BU, key antibiotics, and surgical interventions. Relevant English-language studies on treatment outcomes were reviewed to summarize evolving management trends and emerging therapeutic approaches. <b>Results and Discussion</b>: This review highlights the importance of early diagnosis and timely antimicrobial therapy in preventing disease progression and limb loss. It reviews WHO-recommended antibiotic regimens and discusses the theoretical risk of drug resistance, although clinical resistance remains rare and unreported in Australia. Surgical interventions in select cases are crucial, with timing being a significant factor in functional outcomes. The review also covers pediatric-specific challenges, including growth preservation and psychosocial support for young patients. Reconstructive options focus on limb salvage and staged reconstructions, with multidisciplinary care essential for optimal outcomes. The paper advocates for RCTs to refine treatment protocols, surgical guidelines, and explore emerging antibiotic therapies such as telacebec. <b>Conclusions</b>: BU remains a global health challenge, requiring early diagnosis, timely antimicrobial therapy, and surgery in selected cases.

        "abstract": "<b>Background and objectives:</b> ABs are widely used in dental practice in the treatment of odontogenic infections and as systemic prophylaxis in high-risk patients. However, AB overuse contributes to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which is a major global concern. This study examined dental AB prescribing trends in Germany in 2024, focusing on the share of overall AB prescriptions, patient demographics, and commonly used agents. <b>Methods:</b> This retrospective cross-sectional study used data from the IQVIA Longitudinal Prescription Database (LRx), covering approximately 80% of prescriptions reimbursed by statutory health insurance funds in Germany. Patients with at least one AB prescription (ATC code: J01) issued by a dentist in 2024 were analyzed. Descriptive statistics covered age, sex, and prescribed substances. <b>Results:</b> In 2024, German dentists prescribed ABs to 2,325,500 patients, accounting for 13.9% of all patients in the database who received AB prescriptions. Dentists were the second-largest group of AB prescribers, surpassed only by general physicians. Amoxicillin (54.2%) was most frequently prescribed, followed by amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (24.5%) and clindamycin (21.0%). Dental patients receiving AB prescriptions were older (mean age: 49.8 years) than the general antibiotic patient population (44.7 years). Interestingly, dental AB prescriptions increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, in contrast to the sharp overall decline in AB prescriptions. Between 2015 and 2019, the proportion of dental antibiotic prescriptions showed a moderate upward tendency, followed by a marked increase during the COVID-19 pandemic and a subsequent decline. In contrast, the number of patients receiving antibiotic prescriptions from other medical disciplines decreased over the same period. One particularly notable finding was the extended use of clindamycin, a reserve AB with known side effects and resistance risks, in dentistry. <b>Conclusions:</b> Dentists are responsible for a significant share of AB prescriptions in Germany. The rise in dental AB prescriptions, particularly the frequent prescription of clindamycin, underscores the need for interventions such as updated clinical guidelines and awareness campaigns concerning AB-related risks and their mitigation directed at dentists. These could focus on microbial culture and sensitivity testing and patient adherence education and control for targeted AB interventions. Emphasizing preventive and alternative anti-infective treatment strategies in dentistry may also help to contain AMR.",

        "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance (ABR) to commonly used antibiotics is significant in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In SSA, Chad has one of the highest antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rates. The link between ABR and antibiotic consumption (ABC) is well-established. However, no ABC-related studies have been conducted in Chad recently. The purpose of this study is to examine the trajectory of ABC in Chad from 2017 to 2021, using the World Health Organization's (WHO) Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) antibiotic classification. A descriptive retrospective study was conducted in N'Djamena, using antibiotic import and distribution data collected from the General Directorate of Pharmacy and four wholesale distributors of medicines. The defined daily doses (DDDs) and the mean relative change (MRC) were used to compute the results. Results were presented in terms of tables and graphs. The results were compared to the WHO's guidelines for ABC use via the AWaRe categorization. Between 2017 and 2021, an average ABC of 2.5 doses per inhabitant per year was observed, peaking in 2020 at 5.3 doses per inhabitant. In terms of DDD, the ten most commonly consumed antibiotics during the time, in descending order, were amoxicillin, ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, phenoxymethyl-penicillin, erythromycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and gentamicin. However, the MRC analysis detected an increase in benzathine benzyl penicillin, benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, flucloxacillin, ceftriaxone, cefixime, cefpodoxime and cefalexin, cotrimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and azithromycin. Controversially, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, and moxifloxacin had a lower MRC from 2017 to 2021. Although 90% of the ABC are from the \"Access\" group, the \"Watch\" group has increased over time. Our findings indicated a significant ABC in the Chadian population from 2017 to 2021, which may elucidate the country's elevated ABR. On average, 90% of ABC were categorized in the \"Access\" group, although utilization of the Watch group increased over time. This requires the prompt implementation of the monitoring system for ABC at all tiers in Chad.",

Immunocompromised patients are at increased risk of severe infections, associated with elevated morbidity and mortality.In routine clinical practice, urine cultures are often performed systematically in patients considered at risk of infection, regardless of urinary symptoms, with the aim of detecting and subsequently treating potential asymptomatic bacteriuria.This study aimed to assess the clinical relevance of screening for and potentially treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in immunocompromised individuals. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed and Medline, without restrictions on language or year of publication. This was complemented by an exploration of the scientific grey literature, including expert reports and guidelines from professional societies. Studies were selected using the following keywords: antibiotic treatment, urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, bacteriuria, pyelonephritis, cystitis, immunodeficiency, diabetes, renal transplant, neurogenic bladder, cirrhosis, pregnancy, and antimicrobial resistance. All abstracts and full-text articles were reviewed. The synthesis of the findings was subsequently evaluated by members of the CIAFU expert committee, who formulated the most consensual recommendation possible. Across the reviewed literature, no clear benefit was identified in screening for or treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in immunocompromised patients. It is not recommended to screen for or treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in immunocompromised patients, except in specific, well-established scenarios. Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria does not reduce infection risk; rather, it increases the likelihood of adverse effects and contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance, with its associated morbidity and mortality.",

        "abstract": "From July 23 to 24, 2022, Qingxu People's Hospital in Taiyuan reported an increase in acute gastroenteritis cases among individuals who had dined together.An investigation was initiated to identify factors associated with acute intestinal infection and to prevent further illness. To isolate, cultivate, and identify pathogens, we collected samples from patients, food, and the environment. The isolated strains underwent multiple tests, including antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Based on the WGS data, analyses were conducted, including serotype prediction, resistance gene prediction, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, and phylogenetic analysis. A total of 11 samples were collected from Patient 1's residence and the supermarket. These included 2 samples of leftover food from a family gathering, 4 samples of the supermarket environment, and 5 stool samples from 5 patients. Among these, two strains of Salmonella were isolated from the food, and three strains were isolated from the patients' stools. All five strains of Salmonella were identified as Salmonella Agona (S. Agona) and were susceptible to the 15 antibiotics tested. The PFGE banding patterns were identical among the strains. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the isolated strains were all S. Agona of sequence type ST13 and cgMLST type cgST164980. They all carried the resistance genes aac(6')-laa and fosA7. SNP disparities ranged from 0 to 2. In the phylogenetic tree, the five strains of S. Agona isolated clustered closely together. In this investigation of a food poisoning outbreak caused by S. Agona, we employed two key molecular techniques: Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). PFGE provided initial high-resolution DNA fingerprinting to identify bacterial strains and establish their clonal relatedness, offering preliminary but crucial insights into understanding the microbial causes of the epidemic. Subsequently, WGS delivered comprehensive genetic information with unparalleled precision, confirming that the pathogen was S. Agona and revealing its genomic characteristics. The integration of PFGE and WGS results provided strong evidence proving the epidemic was related to S. Agona. This comprehensive approach not only confirmed the etiology of the food poisoning event but also highlighted the power of molecular and genomic tools in modern epidemiological investigations. Our findings emphasize the importance of these techniques in rapidly and accurately identifying pathogens, thereby enabling timely public health interventions and reinforcing food safety measures to prevent similar outbreaks in the future.",

        "abstract": "In 2020, the World Health Organization published a guideline on the use of mass drug administration (MDA) of the broad-spectrum antibiotic azithromycin to reduce childhood mortality. As MDA-azithromycin to reduce mortality is considered for expansion to more settings and populations, care must be taken to maximize benefits and reduce risks (e.g., antimicrobial resistance or AMR) of this intervention. Completed and ongoing MDA-azithromycin cluster-randomized clinical trials can provide evidence on the extent to which these benefits and risks accrue and identify practices to monitor these effects and address evidence gaps in future trials. We examined azithromycin clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from registry inception to December 31, 2023. We included trials for which azithromycin was administered for the prevention or treatment of a disease or condition that was not explicitly diagnosed or necessary for participant inclusion, and for which treatment was randomized by geographic units. We identified evidence, knowledge gaps, and trends and highlights across five domains: (1) targeting of MDA-azithromycin, (2) clinical endpoints, (3) co- and competing interventions, (4) spillover effects, and (5) AMR monitoring. Of 1589 screened studies, 30 met all inclusion criteria. These trials were conducted in 13 countries, predominantly (26/30) in sub-Saharan Africa. Nearly a third (9/30) of the trials included mortality endpoints, but few (2/9) included cause-specific mortality endpoints. New evidence suggests the benefits of widening the target age group and the persistence of mortality benefits in settings with competing interventions. Published practices to ensure geographic separation of communities in different treatment arms to reduce spillover effects were not customary. We found information on AMR monitoring practices for just over half the trials (16/30). Of these, half (8/16) included both phenotypic and genotypic AMR testing, and more than half collected specimens to assess the nasopharyngeal and gut microbiomes (9/16) and tested for non-macrolide resistance (11/16). Further long-term MDA-azithromycin studies to determine which additional countries could benefit, interventions to accompany or replace this intervention, and the extent to which AMR spillover occurs may prove valuable as guidelines are revised.",

The aim of this study is to assess the resistance patterns of isolated uropathogens among children and adolescents hospitalized with UTIs in Lebanon; and determine the risk factors associated with MDRO-related UTIs over a 10-year period. A retrospective chart review was conducted at two tertiary medical centers in Beirut. Children and adolescents less than 18 years who were admitted, between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2021, with the following ICD-10 codes: \"urinary tract infection\", \"cystitis\" and/or \"pyelonephritis \" were included. A case was excluded if the urine culture was polymicrobial or did not meet the definition of UTI we used. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for MDRO infections. Among the 876 pediatric UTI cases included, 85% were above 2 months of age and 74.1% were females. 64.5% of 644 <i>Escherichia coli</i> and 61.9% of 114 <i>Klebsiella</i> spp. isolates met international MDR criteria. After a period of fluctuation, the proportion of MDROs began to steadily increase starting 2019 eventually surpassing the 2011 percentage by nearly 10% in 2021 (67.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.248). Only 2.1% of MDR <i>E. coli</i> and 2.9% of MDR <i>Klebsiella</i> spp. were resistant to carbapenems. However, aminoglycoside resistance was high ranging between 28.3% and 48.6%.

        "abstract": "Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pose significant challenges to healthcare institutions worldwide. Implementing effective infection prevention and control (IPC) measures is crucial for reducing the risk of HAIs. However, limited research has been conducted on the current status of IPC in secondary and tertiary hospitals in Shaanxi Province, China. This study aims to comprehensively and quantitatively evaluate the IPC practices in these hospitals using the IPC Assessment Framework (IPCAF). A cross-sectional study was conducted in Shaanxi Province, China, from February to April 2024, in collaboration with the Provincial Center for Nosocomial Infection Control and Quality Improvement (NICQI) and 10 regional NICQIs. Using a stratified multistage sampling approach, secondary and tertiary hospitals were selected. Data were collected via electronic questionnaires distributed through WeChat groups. To ensure data quality, a pilot survey was performed, and standardized training was provided to all investigators. A total of 171 hospitals participated in the survey, with 108 secondary hospitals (63.16%) and 63 tertiary hospitals (36.84%). The overall median IPCAF score was 642.5 (inter-quartile range [IQR]: 545-710), with secondary hospitals scoring 600 (IQR: 507.5-682.5) and tertiary hospitals 705 (IQR: 637.5-755), indicating significant differences between hospital grades (P < 0.05). According to WHO criteria, 106 hospitals (61.99%) achieved an \"advanced\" IPC level. Among core component (CC) scores, CC5 (Multimodal strategies) and CC7 (Workload, staffing and bed occupancy) had the lowest median scores (75), while CC8 (Built environment, materials and equipment for IPC at the facility level) and CC2 (IPC guidelines) had the highest median score. Secondary and tertiary hospitals in Shaanxi Province have demonstrated a relatively high level of IPC. However, resource allocation and facility upgrades in secondary hospitals require enhancement. The identified strengths and areas for improvement are in accordance with those observed in other upper-middle income countries, particularly with respect to multimodal strategies.",

        "abstract": "Salmonella poses a significant health threat to both humans and animals owing to the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant strains. There are no studies on the incidence patterns of salmonellosis and multidrug-resistant Salmonella strains in Inner Mongolia, China's milk and beef-producing hotspot. Farms in Inner Mongolia, China, were randomly selected, and rectal swabs (600) and milk samples (757) were collected for isolation and identification of Salmonella, and antimicrobial resistance was assessed according to CLSI and NARMS guidelines. Twenty-one resistance genes from seven classes of antibiotics were selected for detection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Salmonella-NMGS9 was selected for whole genome sequencing and drug resistance gene prediction analysis. Salmonella was found in 24 (85.71%) of the 28 large-scale cattle farms in Inner Mongolia, China, resulting in 176 Salmonella strains from 1357 samples (with a prevalence of 3.88%). Of the 158 strains tested for their susceptibility to 19 antibiotics, multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains accounted for 90.51% (143/158), and 6 strains were only resistant to sulfisoxazole. Furthermore, 40% and 30% of the strains had sul3 and sul1 genes; all strains were sensitive to polymixin B, and no strains had the mcr-1 gene. Among the 8 S. enterica strains (5.59%), 14 genes were identified, with the β-lactam gene bla<sub>TEM-1</sub> expressed in all MDR isolates. Only the floR and tetB genes were consistent with the PCR results for the predicted drug resistance genes in Salmonella-NMGS9 strains. This study is the first to determine the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, and genetic characteristics, of Salmonella spp. isolated from large-scale cattle farms in Inner Mongolia, China. Monitoring the prevalence, resistance gene expression, and distribution of Salmonella on large-scale cattle farms in Inner Mongolia is vital for understanding the extent and trends in foodborne pathogen resistance in China.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of HIV drug resistance is a challenge in controlling the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic caused by human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. Detection of drug resistance variants at minor frequencies can help to formulate successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens for people living with HIV (PLWH) and reduce the emergence of drug resistance. Therefore, a pipeline which can accurately produce consensus nucleotide sequences and identify drug resistance mutations (DRMs) at defined frequency thresholds will be helpful in the treatment of PLWH, analysis of virus evolution, and the control of the pandemic. We have developed a pipeline, HIVGenoPipe, to determine HIV drug resistance variants within the gag-pol region above user-defined frequencies for HIV-1 samples sequenced using Illumina technology. The pipeline has been validated by comparing its results with the results generated by a widely used pipeline, HyDRA, which is limited to the pol region, and with the results generated by Sanger sequencing technology using the same set of 30 samples. The variant frequency used to generate ambiguous consensus sequences in HIVGenoPipe is more accurate than other pipelines because a sample-specific reference, which is generated in real-time with a novel hybrid strategy of de novo and reference-based assembly, is used for the frequency calculation, leading to more accurate drug resistance calls for use by clinicians. In addition, since Nextflow is used as the pipeline platform, HIVGenoPipe inherently has great portability, scalability and reproducibility; and the components can be updated or replaced independently if required. We developed HIVGenoPipe for the detection of HIV-1 drug resistance. It constructs more accurate gag-pol consensus sequences, leading to improved detection of DRMs. HIVGenoPipe is open source and freely available under the MIT license at https://github.com/LHRI-Bioinformatics/HIVGenoPipe .

Microbial resistance emerged almost simultaneously with the discovery of penicillin and has kept pace with almost every new antibiotic molecule. With the increasing AMR and declining initiative for discovery of newer antibiotics from research and pharmacologic industry, humanity may be entering a post-antibiotic era of inability to treat any infection. As per the global estimate, AMR ranks as high as the third leading cause of death. India being the largest consumer of antibiotics faces a huge burden of AMR. ICMR data reveals that methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) prevalence is in more than half the specimens and among the Gram negative organisms, carbapenem resistance is seen in nearly 50% in E. coli and klebsiella in 2023.The contributory factors for AMR are patient, prescriber, system and environment related, as well as the rampant use of antibiotics in animal husbandry, aquaculture and biocides. Government of India is making efforts to restrict AMR through a National Action Plan by strategies such as enhancing knowledge about AMR, improving Antimicrobial Stewardship, monitoring antibiotic use and increasing coordination among stakeholders under 'One Health' initiative. To promote rational antibiotic choice and prevent AMR, WHO has categorised antibiotics as per the level of need as Access, Watch and Reserve (AWaRe) antibiotics. Robust National and WHO guidelines are available to treat all the infections encountered in office practice.",

The outbreak was ultimately mitigated through multimodal infection control interventions aligned with WHO multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) management guidelines. Following index case identification on 10 December 2022, a multidisciplinary outbreak response team implemented comprehensive control measures: Immediate geographic cohorting of CRKP-positive patients with dedicated staff; Enhanced contact precautions including daily chlorhexidine bathing; Tri-daily environmental decontamination using sporicidal agents; Mandatory hand hygiene audits with real-time feedback; Active surveillance through weekly rectal swabs for all RICU admissions. Environmental monitoring encompassed 120 high-touch surfaces sampled weekly. Among 42 laboratory-confirmed CRKP cases, 85.7% (<i>n</i> = 36) were identified through clinical specimens and 14.3% (<i>n</i> = 6) via active surveillance. Post-outbreak surveillance revealed two imported CRKP cases detected through admission screening during the three-month follow-up period, both contained without secondary transmission. The increasing patient volume, prolonged use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and influx of new healthcare workers heightened the risk of CRKP transmission. Effective administrative guidance on nosocomial infections, behavioral control, active surveillance culture, environmental cleanliness and antimicrobial management are essential to prevent outbreak. This outbreak demonstrates the viability of containing CRKP transmission in resource-constrained pandemic settings through: rigorous adherence to contact precautions; prospective CRE active surveillance cultures. It is also need to implement antimicrobial stewardship programs in order to reduce the occurrence of microbial resistance.",

        "abstract": "Isoniazid-resistant, Rifampicin-susceptible Tuberculosis (TB) is estimated to occur in 13% of new cases and 17% of previously treated cases. Current WHO guidelines recommend treatment with Rifampicin (RFP), ethambutol (EMB, E), pyrazinamide (PZA, Z), and levofloxacin (LFX, Q) for 6 months in patients with isoniazid mono-resistant TB (Hr-TB) but the effectiveness and use of other regimens in managing Hr-TB has not been established. There is a need to pay increased attention to the timely identification of Hr-TB patients to improve treatment success along with the reduction of the risk for further drug resistance development. This study was performed to determine the treatment outcomes and their associated factors among isoniazid mono-resistant TB patients in Uganda. This was a cross-sectional study performed among newly diagnosed and retreatment TB patients whose sputum samples were referred to the National TB Reference Laboratory (NTRL)-Uganda from March 2017 to March 2022. Patient samples exhibiting Isoniazid mono-resistance as determined by phenotypic drug resistance testing (DST) were included in this study. Samples with data incompleteness and those whose treatment centers could not be traced were excluded from the study. Selected samples were tested for mutations associated with Isoniazid resistance using line probe. Patient demographic data was obtained from the National TB Reference Laboratory (NTRL) electronic data system and request forms with additional data, such as treatment regimen, adverse effects, and treatment start dates obtained from treatment registers. The independent variables available (age, sex, regimen used, M. tuberculosis mutation genes for isoniazid, specifically InhA and KatG, history of TB, HIV status, and reporting year) were assessed as possible factors in the relationship between Hr-TB and treatment success. A total of 85 isoniazid monoresistant isolates from different patients were analyzed in this study. In this study, most of the participants belonged to the category of newly diagnosed 35/85 (41.2%). Most of the participants 36/85, 42.3%) turned culture negative at month one upon initiation of treatment. The findings from this study show that the most dominant Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutation occurred in the KatG MUT1 region with a nucleotide change of S315T1. There was no significant treatment outcome difference among the different age groups in this study when compared (unsuccessful Vs successful treatment, median age 35.4 years and 35.86 years, p = 0.078). However, the study found that most deaths were among people aged above 36 years 71.4%, (5/7 participants). This study revealed Isoniazid mono-resistant TB as a significant factor associated with delayed culture conversion of beyond two (2) months. This emphasizes the need for prompt detection using routine point-of-care testing molecular diagnostic platforms to test for Isoniazid and Rifampicin resistance to improve TB treatment outcomes and reduce failures.

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a critical global issue, with bacteria increasingly resistant to traditional antibiotics, resulting in more treatment failures and higher mortality rates. Resistance can be defined microbiologically or clinically and arises through genetic mutations or acquired traits. In response to this growing threat, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in 2016 to guide the research and development of new antimicrobial agents. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated AMR, underscoring the urgent need for new antibiotics. Natural products continue to be a valuable source of antibacterial compounds and play a significant role in developing new antimicrobial treatments. This study employed a systematic review methodology, conducting comprehensive searches across PUBMED/MEDLINE, WEB OF SCIENCE, and SCOPUS databases, adhering to modified PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines. A research librarian assisted in developing the search strategy, with searches executed on May 5, 2024, without restrictions on publication dates. Titles and abstracts were screened using Rayyan and Endnote. Inclusion criteria focused on original studies examining the antimicrobial effects of natural products against antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals. The review identified significant effects of natural products on 12 families of antibiotic-resistant bacteria as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). These findings underscore the potential of natural compounds as therapeutic agents in combating antimicrobial resistance. A total of 4371 articles published between 2014 and 2024 were initially identified, from which 290 articles were selected for detailed review based on their relevance to the study period. All included studies were clinical trials. The analysis indicated that most of the research on dietary plants was conducted in countries within the Middle East, South America, and Africa. Among the pathogens investigated, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, and Staphylococcus aureus emerged as the most frequently studied due to their involvement in a wide range of infectious diseases. The findings revealed that alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, saponins, tannins, and terpenoids were the principal classes of plant-derived compounds exhibiting antioxidant activity against bacterial strains. These bioactive compounds were extracted using a variety of solvents, including ethanol, methanol, aqueous solutions, benzoate, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and methanolic preparations obtained from different plant parts such as leaves, bark, flowers, and roots. Notably, flavonoids represented 24.8% of the antioxidant product derivatives examined. The overall results underscore the significant therapeutic potential of regional medicinal plants in combating pathogens resistant to chemical drugs. Their antioxidant and cytotoxic properties may enhance the efficacy of existing antibiotic classes and contribute to reversing antimicrobial resistance. Based on the findings of this review, the diverse effects and therapeutic efficacy of herbal compounds in managing antibiotic resistance were extensively examined. Consequently, in light of the demonstrated antimicrobial activities of these plant-derived compounds, further investigation into their potential as alternative agents to counteract antibiotic resistance has become increasingly essential.",

        "abstract": "Drug-resistant tuberculosis has emerged as a major public health issue that requires immediate attention. NTS is an innovative method that allows for the direct detection of clinical samples without the need for culture. It could provide more accurate, reliable, and comprehensive information on drug resistance. We collected clinical data retrospectively from patients suspected of having drug-resistant tuberculosis who visited the tuberculosis department at the Second Hospital of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, China, from December 2023 to December 2024. The diagnostic efficiency of NTS for different types of drug-resistant tuberculosis and antimicrobial resistance was calculated. The relationship between resistance genes, mutated amino acids, and mutation sites was demonstrated. In this study, a total of 107 patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis were included, comprising 43 cases of mono-drug resistant tuberculosis, 20 patients with poly-drug resistant tuberculosis, 22 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, 21 cases of pre-extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and 1 case of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. The accuracy of NTS in diagnosing drug-resistant tuberculosis ranged from 42.9 to 93.0%. Except for second-line injectable drugs, NTS achieved a sensitivity of over 70% for other anti-tuberculosis drugs. Serine was identified as the most frequently mutated amino acid in both the rpoB gene (66.2%, 49/74) and the katG gene (86.3%, 44/51). Additionally, the most frequently mutated amino acids in the embB gene, rpsL gene, and gyrA gene were methionine (94.7%, 44/51), lysine (100%, 28/28), and aspartic acid (66.7%, 20/30), respectively. NTS could effectively and precisely deliver comprehensive drug resistance results, assisting medical professionals to create more personalized treatment plans. Besides, it would encourage the development of new anti-tuberculosis drugs to broaden clinical treatment options for drug-resistant tuberculosis.",

        "abstract": "Veterinarians primarily engage pet owners in shared decision-making (SDM) to enhance treatment outcomes and owner satisfaction, but not specifically for antibiotic stewardship. This study aims to understand how SDM occurs and how to better involve pet owners in appropriate antibiotic prescribing for their pets. This is a concurrent mixed methods study, anchoring on survey data collected from 1080 pet cat/dog owners (March─December 2023) supplemented by qualitative insights from 19 veterinarians (January─July 2022). Statistical and thematic analyses were performed. Of those who received antibiotics for their pet during the last veterinary consultation (N = 415), only 22.7% engaged in SDM with their veterinarians on antibiotic prescribing. Pet owners with high degree of control and empowerment to interact with veterinary professionals were more likely to do so. Veterinarians were capable of engaging pet owners in SDM; exploring owners' needs and feeding concerns was key. Pet owners trusted veterinarians' final antibiotic decisions and desired appropriate antibiotic prescriptions from them, alongside training and advice on how best to medicate their pets with antibiotics. Proactive exploration of pet owners' needs and concerns, and providing pet owners with necessary training and advice, can enhance antibiotic stewardship for pet cats and dogs.",

        "abstract": "The epidemiology of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infection in South-East Asia remains inadequately understood. This study aimed to systematically review and analyze the available evidence on NG prevalence to provide an understanding of the epidemiology in this region, highlighting prevalence patterns, key populations at risk, and factors influencing transmission. A systematic review of the literature up to September 3, 2024, was conducted, with findings reported in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate the pooled mean prevalence, while meta-regression analyses were conducted to explore associations, assess time trends, and identify sources of heterogeneity across studies. The review identified 474 relevant publications, encompassing 885 overall and 1136 stratified NG prevalence measures. The pooled mean prevalence of urogenital infection was 0.5% (95% CI: 0.3-0.8%) in general populations, 13.9% (95% CI: 11.9-16.1%) among female sex workers, 16.8% (95% CI: 12.6-21.5%) among sexually transmitted infection clinic attendees, 4.6% (95% CI: 2.9-6.5%) in symptomatic women, and 38.5% (95% CI: 31.8-45.3%) in symptomatic men. Among men who have sex with men, transgender people, and male and transgender sex workers, the pooled mean prevalence was 0.9% (95% CI: 0.4-1.5%) for urogenital infection, 12.0% (95% CI: 8.8-15.7%) for anorectal infection, and 7.1% (95% CI: 4.0-10.9%) for oropharyngeal infection. Multivariable meta-regression analyses explained over 55% of the variation in prevalence, revealing a hierarchical pattern by population type, higher prevalence among men, and a decline in prevalence of 2% per calendar year over the past four decades. NG prevalence in South-East Asia is comparable to the global prevalence. The markedly high prevalence among key populations, coupled with Asia's substantial burden of gonococcal antimicrobial resistance, underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions focused on these vulnerable groups.",

Digital clinical decision support algorithms (CDSAs) help healthcare workers adhere to clinical guidelines and improve prescribing practices. In this manuscript, we present the scope and content of 'ePOCT+ Rwanda' (electronic Point-Of-Care Tests +), a CDSA trialed in primary health centers of Rusizi and Nyamasheke districts during the DYNAMIC project. The algorithm is based on the WHO IMCI guidelines, expanded to include a broader range of ages (between 1 day and 14 years, inclusive) and acute medical conditions encountered in primary care (57 diagnoses for young infants < 2 months and 144 diagnoses for children 2 months to 14 years). The digital application used to deploy ePOCT+ prompts users to enter the results of medical history, physical examinations and laboratory tests to propose diagnoses, treatments and managements. In addition to routine point-of-care tests, ePOCT+ utilizes haemoglobin and C-reactive protein tests, as well as pulse oximetry, targeted to specific clinical conditions. We discuss the rationale behind the content of the algorithm and the process of aligning it with the Rwandan paediatric guidelines and tailoring it to the primary care setting.",

Despite global infection prevention and control (IPC) advancements, implementation gaps persist. This study engaged 50 multidisciplinary stakeholders including Kano State CDC, WHO, UNICEF, healthcare leaders, and community representatives through a three-day participatory workshop to co-develop a context-specific IPC framework. Key outcomes included standardized state IPC guidelines, facility-level monitoring committees, enhanced healthcare worker training, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) protocols, and dedicated isolation centers. The initiative reduced HAIs by 42% (<i>p < 0.01</i>) in pilot facilities, with notable improvements in pediatric and maternal wards. Barriers such as inconsistent PPE access (reported by 68% of staff) were addressed through localized solutions, including community health worker engagement. Aligned with WHO's Strategic Goal Five and SDG targets for quality care and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) reduction, this model demonstrates how stakeholder-driven IPC strategies can mitigate outbreaks in high-burden settings. Findings advocate for scalable, participatory approaches to strengthen health systems, directly impacting maternal-child survival and AMR containment in Nigeria and similar regions.",

        "abstract": "Although the pursuit of effective and safe early detection methods for prostate cancer has led to advancements in non-invasive tools, there are approximately one million prostate biopsies per year performed annually in the EU [11]. The use of the transperineal approach to prostate biopsy is increasing because it offers a significantly reduced incidence of post-biopsy sepsis complications compared to transrectal biopsies and therefore is the recommended approach in the European Association of Urology guidelines. However, the consensus on the standard of care for antibiotic prophylaxis in some or all transperineal biopsy cases is only beginning to be established. As with transrectal biopsies, there are concerns about antibiotic stewardship, antibiotic side effects and labor and material costs associated with prophylaxis. This retrospective study analyzed 636 patients who underwent transperineal prostate biopsies without the use of antibiotic prophylaxis between January 2019 and August 2020. The primary endpoint was the rate of postinterventional infectious complications, with secondary endpoints including the rate of general complications and associated risk factors. The rate of all complications was 1.9%. There were 7/636 (1.1%) infectious complications, of which 3 (0.50%) were prostatitis, 1 (0.16%) was epididymitis, 2 (0.3%) were infections resulting in hospitalization and 1 (0.16%) urosepsis with ICU care. No identified risk factors were associated with infectious complications or post-interventional bleeding. Notably, the cohort was not systematically screened for bacteriuria before biopsy, and patients usually categorized as high risk for post-biopsy complications were not excluded. The rates of infectious complications and sepsis were lower than that reported for transrectal biopsies with antibiotic prophylaxis. This study supports the relative safety of omitting antibiotic prophylaxis in transperineal prostate biopsies, showcasing a minimal infectious complication rate. The findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on antibiotic stewardship, emphasizing the need for judicious use to mitigate resistance, avoid allergic side effects and decrease the labor and material costs associated with transperineal prostate biopsy.",

        "abstract": "Delayed antibiotics increase mortality in bloodstream infection (BSI). Direct-from-blood-culture disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing (dAST) forecasts susceptibility earlier than conventional susceptibility testing (cAST). The study aimed to evaluate dAST performance and its impact on antibiotic adjustment in BSI. In this Malaysian single-center prospective study, dAST was performed and interpreted according to breakpoints by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The turnaround time (TAT), categorical agreements (CA), and predictive values of dAST for susceptibility by cAST were determined among positive blood cultures (PBC) between November 2022 and November 2023. The active and WHO AWaRe antibiotics administered before and after dAST results were compared. Of the 318 PBCs, the median of TAT was earlier than cAST by 35 hours. The CA for 3,561 organism-antibiotics combinations was 91.5%, with 3.6% very major errors (VME), 3.3% major errors (ME), and 5.2% minor errors (mE). The dAST achieved CA above 90% for <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> with cefoxitin (98.5%), <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> with ceftazidime (100%), and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> with ampicillin/sulbactam (100%). For Enterobacterales, most combinations were above 90%, including ampicillin (95.1%), ceftriaxone (95.7%), and meropenem (95.7%), though those of the aminopenicillin/inhibitor combinations were above 80%. Most errors were attributed to mEs. Among 159 BSI, the prescribing of active antibiotics improved significantly following dAST (73.0% versus 89.3%, <i>P</i> < 0.001) but not WHO Access antibiotics (35.8% versus 35.2%, <i>P</i> = 0.188). dAST had good CAs for most antibiotics, allowing earlier improvement in active antibiotics. The modest change in WHO Access antibiotics prescribing reveals practice gaps in need of antimicrobial stewardship. Global deaths attributable to antimicrobial resistance are rising. Hence, rapid susceptibility testing is essential for timely antibiotic de-escalation to mitigate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) development from exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Compared to the costly advanced technology, direct disk diffusion from blood culture (diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing [dAST]) is an affordable method that can be quickly adopted. However, the reliability of dAST in informing susceptibility was mainly reported from Western countries and scarcely from other regions, including Southeast Asia, where the AMR burden is high. This study from Malaysia adds insights into the performance of dAST and the potential to apply it in similar resource-limited settings from the same region. Furthermore, assessing the dAST's influence on antibiotic prescribing identifies the gap in implementation to guide areas of improvement for optimizing clinical utility.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a growing threat to global health, with wound infections serving as significant reservoirs for multidrug-resistant bacteria. Understanding the socio-demographic, clinical, and microbiological characteristics of wound infections is critical for effective intervention strategies in resource-limited settings. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the diversity, bacterial profiles, and resistance patterns of wound infections at Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital. To do this, a total of 118 bacterial isolates from wound swabs were collected from 149 patients who met the eligibility criteria, from May to November 2024. These samples were cultured and analysed using standard microbiological techniques and antibiotic susceptibility testing according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Resistance genes associated with Vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus xylosus were also investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with appropriate primers and agarose gel electrophoresis. The results revealed a predominance of male patients (n = 79; 53.02%), avulsions (n = 50; 34.00%), and wounds on lower limbs (n = 63; 42.29%). Escherichia coli (n = 33; 27.97%), Enterobacter gergoviae (n = 20; 16.95%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 18; 15.25%), and Staphylococcus xylosus (n = 18; 15.25%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens. Alarmingly high resistance rates were observed against ACCESS antibiotics, including Cotrimoxazole-Trimethoprim (n = 114; 97%), Ampicillin (n = 109; 92%), and Streptomycin (n = 100; 85%). Resistance to Watch and Reserve antibiotics, including Vancomycin (n = 11; 29%) and Ceftriaxone (n = 27; 33%), was also documented, particularly among Gram-positive isolates such as Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Resistance genes (VanA, VanB, VanC) were detected in S. aureus and S. xylosus, underscoring the role of genetic mechanisms in resistance propagation. These findings highlight the critical need for targeted antimicrobial stewardship programmes and strengthened infection prevention measures in high-burden hospital settings, such as Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital. This study underscores the importance of local resistance data in guiding empirical therapy and informs policies to mitigate AMR in resource-limited contexts. Moreover, enhanced surveillance and research into alternative therapies are crucial to safeguarding the efficacy of life-saving antibiotics and improving patient care outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, particularly members of the ESKAPE group and <i>Escherichia coli</i> (collectively referred to as ESKAPEEc), are major contributors to bloodstream infections (BSIs) and pose significant treatment challenges. This study aimed to characterize the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of ESKAPEEc isolates from BSIs in public hospitals in the uMgungundlovu District, South Africa, and to assess their resistance to World Health Organization (WHO) Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) antibiotics. Between November 2017 and December 2018, blood samples (<i>n</i> = 195) were collected from adult and paediatric patients with suspected BSIs. Isolates were identified using the VITEK 2 system and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and interpreted according to EUCAST/CLSI guidelines. The multiple antibiotic resistance index (MARI) was calculated. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess associations between MARI and clinical variables, including ward type and facility level. Out of 195 presumptive isolates, 159 were confirmed as ESKAPEEc. The most frequently identified pathogens were <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (28.9%) and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (28.3%). High resistance rates were observed across WHO Access and Watch antibiotics, including ampicillin (76% in <i>E. coli</i>), gentamicin (67.4% in <i>K. pneumoniae</i>), and ciprofloxacin (≥ 60% in most species). Carbapenem resistance in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> reached 90%. Overall, 94.9% of isolates were MDR, and 93.1% had MARI ≥ 0.2. Significant differences in MARI values were observed across ward groups and facility levels, with the highest values recorded in intensive care units (mean = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.62-0.72) and tertiary hospitals (mean = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.60-0.68), compared to regional hospitals (mean = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.47-0.57). The findings reveal a high burden of MDR ESKAPEEc in BSIs and widespread resistance to WHO Watch antibiotics.

        "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) has emerged as a major public health threat in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in Egypt, due to its remarkable ability to acquire and transfer resistance genes, as highlighted in the WHO bacterial Priority Pathogens List 2024 classification. This pilot study aimed to characterize 18 A. baumannii isolates from Egyptian healthcare settings, focusing on clonal lineages, antibiotic resistance determinants, horizontal gene transfer potential, and the presence of virulence factors and chromosomal mutations. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed to determine resistance profiles using minimum inhibitory concentrations. Whole-genome sequencing was used to identify β-lactamase, carbapenemase, and other antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), as well as mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Clonal relationships among isolates were assessed via core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). Phenotypic analysis revealed that 72% of the isolates were extensively drug-resistant (XDR), exhibiting resistance to all tested antibiotics except colistin. Clonal diversity analysis identified 11 Oxford sequence types (STs), including two novel STs (ST3309<sup>OXF</sup> and ST3321<sup>OXF</sup>), and six international clonal (IC) groups, with IC2 being the most prevalent. Additionally, eight Pasteur STs were detected, with ST570<sup>PAS</sup> being the most frequent. The cgMLST analysis showed that two Egyptian ST570<sup>PAS</sup> isolates clustered with a strain from Saudi Arabia, suggesting potential regional transmission. Genomic analysis revealed the widespread dissemination of ARGs via MGEs, particularly rep plasmids and insertion sequence elements, which contributed significantly to genomic diversity and antibiotic resistance. This pilot study highlights the clonal diversity of A. baumannii in Egypt and underscores the critical role of MGEs in the spread of resistance genes. Targeted genomic surveillance and infection control are essential to curb the spread of high-risk resistant A. baumannii clones in Egyptian clinical settings.",

This study assessed adherence to WHO/INRUD prescribing indicators in public hospitals and determined each hospital's Index of Rational Drug Prescribing (IRDP). A retrospective descriptive study was conducted in 25 public hospitals across rural, peri-urban, and urban settings in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Data from 5091 patient encounters were analyzed to assess prescribing indicators, including the average number of medicines per encounter, generic prescribing, adherence to the Essential Medicines List (EML), antibiotic use, and injection prescribing. IRDP scores were calculated, and geographic comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), with <i>p</i> < 0.05 considered statistically significant. No hospital met the WHO target of <2 medicines per encounter (regional average: 3.63 ± 0.62). Generic prescribing averaged 72.26%, and EML adherence was 91.85%, with no hospital achieving 100%. Antibiotic prescribing exceeded the <30% target, averaging 60.84%. Injection use aligned best with WHO standards (average: 13.42%), with 22 of 25 hospitals meeting the <20% threshold.

The aims of this study were to report Euro-GASP 2022 data and to compare with the most recently published Euro-GASP data (from 2016 to 2019), to identify changes in AMR and in risk groups for AMR. In this observational study, 23 EU/EEA countries submitted AMR data for gonococcal isolates from 2022, linked to patient epidemiological data, to The European Surveillance System (TESSy). Statistical analyses (Z-test) were used to determine the significance of the differences between the epidemiological data and proportion of AMR isolates in 2022 versus 2019 and 2016. The risk factors associated with AMR isolates were assessed using univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses of odds ratios. Ceftriaxone resistance in 2022 (0.03%, 1/3008) remained low (0.06% (2/3239) in 2019), and cefixime resistance (0.3%, 10/3008) had decreased (0.8% (26/3239) in 2019). Azithromycin resistance (24.9%, 749/3008) and ciprofloxacin resistance (65.8%, 1980/3008) had increased (9.0% (284/3159) and 57.4% (1665/2884), respectively, in 2019). A marked increase in the number (575; 502 in 2019) and proportion (19.2%; 15.8% in 2019) of female gonorrhoea cases was also identified in 2022. In the univariate analysis, azithromycin resistance was associated with oropharyngeal (OR 1.67, CI 1.28-2.18; p < 0.0001) and anorectal infections (OR 1.38, CI 1.08-1.76; p = 0.0094), men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) (OR 3.88, CI 2.80-5.37; p < 0.0001), and females (1.71, CI 1.21-2.41; p = 0.0022). In the multivariable logistic regression model, only azithromycin resistance and MSM remained associated (OR 2.85, CI 1.33-4.73; p = 0.0040). While ceftriaxone resistance remains sporadically detected in Euro-GASP, the increase in reports of occasional ceftriaxone resistance in EU/EEA countries and substantial increase in azithromycin resistance underscore the urgent need for enhanced AMR surveillance. The Euro-GASP data is crucial for refining treatment guidelines and mitigating the spread of AMR gonococcal strains. Novel effective antimicrobials for gonorrhoea treatment remain imperative. ECDC.",

        "abstract": "Over-the-counter antibiotic sales in community-pharmacies significantly drive antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to inappropriate use and early treatment discontinuation. In Bangladesh, community pharmacies, which dispense 56.6 % of antibiotics without prescriptions, serve as the first health-seeking touchpoint, yet conventional stewardship strategies often overlook these informal providers, heightening AMR risks. This study examines drug-sellers' understanding and practices towards antibiotic dispensing and compares their symptomatic-treatment practices with Bangladesh's Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) to understand the extent of antibiotic misuse. A cross-sectional survey in two urban and two rural areas of Bangladesh involved 120 drug-sellers from 30 randomly selected pharmacies per site. Knowledge was compared between drug-sellers with pharmacy-dispensing training and those without training, and their suggested treatments for two simulated health-symptoms-upper respiratory-tract and gastrointestinal infections-were evaluated against STGs to determine the extent of misuse. Most drug-sellers were aged 41-50 years (35.0 %), with 39.2 % holding a bachelor's degree or higher, and 65.8 % having pharmacy-dispensing training. The overall knowledge score on antibiotic use and AMR was moderate at 60.2 % (5-7 out of 10), with 32.5 % scoring ≤4, indicating poor knowledge; trained drug-sellers scored significantly better (<i>p</i> = 0.008). Over half (57.5 %) were unaware of antibiotic dispensing policies, though most (75.8 %) acknowledged the link between AMR and antibiotic use. For simulated upper respiratory-tract infections, 54.2 % recommended single antibiotic-90.8 % Watch, 9.2 % Access (per WHO-AWaRe classification)-with 66.2 % of these prescriptions deviating from guidelines due to inappropriate selection or dosage. For gastrointestinal infections, 55.8 % recommended single antibiotic (40.3 % Watch, 59.7 % Access), with 82.1 % deviated from the guidelines. Additionally, 26.7 % recommended two antibiotics (51.6 % Watch, 48.4 % Access), all of which were inconsistent with guideline recommendations. For both simulated symptoms, no significant difference was observed in drug sellers' treatment practices based on their knowledge level. This study highlights the need for context-specific policies and regulatory measures in informal healthcare settings. While improving drug-sellers' knowledge is vital for antimicrobial stewardship in LMICs like Bangladesh, it alone is insufficient due to market competition, weak regulation, and patient-driven demand. Thus, curbing inappropriate antibiotic use at the community level requires stronger enforcement and multifaceted, context-tailored interventions-including public awareness, targeted training, and market-responsive strategies.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) pose a significant global health challenge, with Southeast Asia bearing a disproportionately high burden due to socio-demographic vulnerabilities, disparities in healthcare access, and prevailing cultural stigmas. Despite growing research interest in the region, a comprehensive synthesis of disease burden, risk factors, and intervention strategies remains limited.<b>Objectives:</b> This study aimed to systematically review research trends, study populations, and pathogen distributions of STDs in Southeast Asia to identify evidence gaps and inform future policy and intervention strategies.<b>Methods:</b> A systematic literature search was conducted using Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Eligible studies were those focusing on STDs in Southeast Asia and included high-risk populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers, youth, heterosexual men and women, transgender individuals, and people living with HIV (PLHIV). The review encompassed key STDs including HIV/AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, HPV, trichomoniasis, and hepatitis B & C.<b>Results:</b> From 2,867 records, 58 studies met the inclusion criteria. HIV/AIDS was the most frequently studied STD (80%), while bacterial STDs and transgender populations were significantly underrepresented. Most studies employed cross-sectional designs (60%), with few longitudinal or interventional studies. Geographically, research was concentrated in Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, with limited representation from Cambodia, Vietnam, and Indonesia.<b>Discussion:</b> The findings underscore substantial research gaps, particularly in bacterial STDs, studies involving heterosexual and transgender populations, and the application of intervention-based designs. Inconsistencies in reporting standards and population definitions further limit the comparability of findings across studies.<b>Conclusion:</b> This review highlights the need for more inclusive and methodologically diverse research on STDs in Southeast Asia. Future efforts should prioritize standardized data collection frameworks, improved surveillance systems, and greater emphasis on intervention studies to strengthen evidence-based public health responses in the region.",

        "abstract": "The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria pose a significant global threat to public health. One of the main drivers of this spread is the horizontal transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes via conjugative plasmids. In this study, we isolated a novel phage, PDP46, which specifically targets Escherichia coli strains carrying a conjugative plasmid that encodes antibiotic resistance genes. PDP46 requires a conjugative IncF plasmid for infection, enabling it to selectively target bacterial strains capable of plasmid-mediated gene transfer. Phylogenetic analysis based on the major capsid protein revealed that PDP46 clusters with several phages that use O-antigen as a receptor. However, the tail fiber of PDP46 differs from those of the clustered phages, suggesting that the tail fiber structure of PDP46 may play a key role in its plasmid-dependent infectivity. Furthermore, to explore its therapeutic potential, we evaluated PDP46's effects on the gut microbiota using an in vitro human fecal incubation model. Our findings suggest that phage PDP46 could inhibit the growth of target bacteria harboring conjugative plasmids without disrupting overall microbial diversity. By inhibiting the growth of donor cells carrying antibiotic resistance-associated plasmids, PDP46 may serve as a targeted gut microbiota modulator.",

With rapid spreading throughout the country, CRF55_01B has attracted much attention in recent years. This study aimed to analyze its prevalence of drug resistance and transmission characteristics in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Henan province, China so as to pay particular attention to this group of individuals to reduce the incidence of drug resistance. Two hundred and forty-five CRF55_01B-infected individuals, including 141 treatment-naïve and 104 treatment-experienced individuals, were enrolled. In treatment-naïve individuals, 6.38% (9/141) of them harboured NRTI DRMs and 19.15% (27/141) of them harboured NNRTI DRMs except V179E/D. In treatment-experienced individuals, 2.00% (2/100) harboured INSTI DRMs, 82.69% (86/104) of them harboured NRTI DRMs, and 88.46% (92/104) of them harboured NNRTI DRMs except V179E/D. The overall prevalence of ADR was 89.42% (93/104), while the prevalence of PDR was 19.86% (28/141). A total of 23 transmission clusters, accounting for 37.55% (92/245) of the total sequences, were identified. The clusters ranged in size from 2 to 19, and 15 (65.22%) had 3 or more sequences. High prevalence of DRMs and drug resistance were observed in CRF55_01B in both treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced individuals, particular attention should be paid to this group of individuals to reduce the incidence of drug resistance.",

        "abstract": "<i>Lactobacillaceae</i> is a large family of bacteria from which probiotic strains often originate. Microorganisms used as feed additives in the EU must meet a number of formal criteria, some of which concern antimicrobial susceptibility. In this study, we determined the susceptibility of 19 reference strains and 121 wild-type strains of <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> to aminoglycoside antibiotics using the broth microdilution method based on the ISO 10932:2010/IDF 223:2010 standard. Strains were categorized as resistant or susceptible according to European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidelines. Resistance genes were detected by whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis or by PCR. The MICs read after 48 h of incubation showed that 36.8% of reference strains were resistant to kanamycin, 26.3% to streptomycin, and 5.3% to gentamicin, with no aminoglycoside resistance genes detected in any genome. As many as 93.2% of field isolates of <i>Ligilactobacillus salivarius</i>, 85% of <i>Ligilactobacillus agilis</i>, and 58.8% of <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> were classified as resistant to kanamycin, with the <i>aac(6)-Ie-aph(2)-Ia</i> gene detected only in two isolates. In six of 12 streptomycin-resistant strains, the <i>ant(6)-Ia</i> gene was identified, which usually coexisted with the <i>spw</i> gene. Three isolates with high neomycin MICs harbored the <i>ant(4')-Ia</i> gene. In <i>Lactobacillus gallinarum</i> strain LMG 9435, characterized by streptomycin MIC value > 1024 µg/mL, a potential resistance-causing mutation in the <i>rpsL</i> gene (Lys56 → Arg) was detected. The results of the study indicate that some genera of <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, in particular <i>L. salivarius</i> and <i>L. agilis</i>, exhibit natural resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, mainly kanamycin. Therefore, there is a need to update the EFSA guidelines on antimicrobial susceptibility testing of <i>Lactobacillaceae,</i> so that strains lacking resistance genes and/or chromosomal mutations are not considered to be resistant.",

        "abstract": "Interprofessional Education (IPE) is essential in improving patient outcomes by promoting teamwork and collaboration among healthcare professionals. This study aimed to assess the impact of IPE on developing clinical competencies and collaborative practices in Egyptian intensive care units (ICUs). The core modules focused on managing antibiotic resistance, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and mechanical ventilation (MV), chosen for their high prevalence in Egyptian ICUs and significant impact on patient outcomes. The IPE program was implemented across seven governorates, involving 16 hospitals and multidisciplinary ICU teams. It was conducted in two consecutive four-month waves, each covering the three core modules. Participants included physicians, clinical pharmacists, and ICU nurses. To enhance efficacy, a blended learning approach combined virtual webinars, case-based discussions, and in-person workshops. Data collection included pre- and post-tests, a post-training satisfaction survey, and the Interdisciplinary Education Perception Scale (IEPS) to assess competency improvements. The IPE program included 157 participants, with 79 in wave 1 and 78 in wave 2. Physicians were mostly male (47.2%) and older (> 40 years), while clinical pharmacists and ICU nurses were younger and predominantly female (89.6% and 75.7%, respectively). For exam performance, clinical pharmacists had the highest excellence rate (22.4%), while ICU nurses had the highest failure rate (40.5%). Post-training, interprofessional competence improved significantly, with physicians showing the greatest competency gains (p < 0.05) and clinical pharmacists playing a key role in antibiotic resistance management (p = 0.029). Overall satisfaction was high across modules, increasing from 79.8% in Module 1 to 90.5% in Module 3. Higher satisfaction was observed among females (up to 89.5%), participants aged 30-40 (92.6% in Module 2), and those who received sufficient program information (p = 0.011), with lecturers median score rated consistently 5.0, while material satisfaction median score varied (4.0-4.8). The IPE program improved interprofessional collaboration and clinical competency, despite challenges such as participant dropout, scheduling conflicts, and engagement in virtual sessions. By addressing issues like antimicrobial resistance and critical care management, it provides a practical model for improving healthcare outcomes, particularly in resource-limited settings. This program is a preliminary step, with plans to expand to more hospitals in Egypt and conduct further research on its long-term impact on patient outcomes and potential for replication in healthcare systems worldwide.

        "abstract": "<i>Mycoplasma genitalium</i> (MG) is a sexually transmitted bacterium of public health importance, associated with genitourinary disorders, and adverse reproductive and perinatal outcomes. Global data on MG prevalence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are primarily available from high-income countries, whereas there is a dearth of information from resource-constrained settings including sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, international data on MG rates and AMR in the antenatal population are scarce. Understanding MG prevalence and AMR patterns is crucial for developing effective public health strategies and treatment guidelines. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and epidemiology of MG and the presence of macrolide resistance-associated mutations (MRAMs) among pregnant women attending antenatal care facilities in Zambia. A cross-sectional study was conducted at four antenatal care facilities in Nchelenge, Zambia, among 1,021 pregnant women. Vaginal swabs were collected and tested using the Aptima <i>Mycoplasma genitalium</i> assay, Aptima Combo 2 assay and Aptima <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i> assay on the Panther System (Hologic). MG-positive samples were further analyzed for MRAMs using the ResistancePlus™ MG assay (SpeeDx). The prevalence of MG was 12.6% (127 of 1,005 valid samples) among the pregnant women. Only 12 MG-positive women (9.4%) had symptoms of a genitourinary infection, which was similar to the frequency of genitourinary symptoms among MG-negative women (6.1%). The rates of <i>Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis</i>, and HIV seropositivity were 7.4, 8.3, 23.0, and 8.6%, respectively. MG infection was significantly associated with the presence of all other tested sexually transmitted infections and HIV seropositivity: the detection rates of <i>C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis</i>, and HIV seropositivity were significantly higher in MG-positive than in MG-negative women (15.1% vs. 6.2, 15.0% vs. 7.5, 32.3% vs. 22.0, and 14.3% vs. 7.5%, respectively). The ResistancePlus™ MG assay detected MG in 66.1% (84/127) of samples positive by the Aptima <i>M. genitalium</i> assay, however, no MRAMs were detected in the 23S rRNA gene for any of these 84 samples. This study emphasizes the high prevalence of MG among pregnant women in Zambia, but also lack of MRAMs in MG. These findings suggest that azithromycin remains an efficacious treatment option for MG in this population. Nevertheless, continuous surveillance and judicious macrolide use to maintain treatment efficacy are imperative. Further research and sustained monitoring of MG are essential to inform public health strategies and clinical guidelines in Zambia and similar settings worldwide.",

        "abstract": "In China, Henan Province is a region with a high HIV burden. Furthermore, drug resistance (DR) among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is becoming a critical barrier to achieving viral suppression. Monitoring DR in PLWHA with detectable viremia after ART is crucial, especially given the widespread use of NNRTI and NRTI, which have historically been the backbone of China's national ART program due to affordability and availability. In this study, plasma samples from PLWHA with viral load (VL) ≥ 40 copies/mL after ≥ 6 months of ART from January 2023 to December 2023 were collected for genotypic DR testing. Of 804 individuals with detectable viremia, a total of 14 HIV-1 subtypes were detected. The top five subtypes were B (55.97%, 450/804), CRF01_AE (22.14%, 178/804), CRF07_BC (15.42%, 124/804), CFR55_01B (3.36%, 27/804), and CRF08_BC (1.00%, 8/804). DR analysis revealed a prevalence of 67.79% (545/804). The resistance rates for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) were 62.94% (506/804), 53.23% (428/804), 7.34% (59/804), and 3.98% (32/804), respectively. The prevalence of DR among PLWHA below and ≥ 200 copies/mL were 40.63% (13/32) and 68.91% (532/772), respectively. Multivariate regression analysis showed that age < 29 years and 40-49 years, baseline CD4 count < 500 cells/µL, current VL of 10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>5</sup> copies/mL, and initial ART regimen of NRTIs + NNRTIs were closely associated with the occurrence of DR. These findings highlight the urgent need for expanded access to drug resistance testing and the adoption of WHO-recommended regimens, such as dolutegravir (DTG), to mitigate the growing threat of DR. Our results suggest that drug resistance testing should be applied to all PLWHA with detectable viremia, and treatment strategies should be optimized to align with global guidelines.",

In Zambia's primary healthcare (PHC) settings, data on ASPs and antibiotic utilisation were inadequate to guide improvements. As a first step, this study assessed antibiotic prescribing and ASP core elements among PHC first-level hospitals (FLHs) in Zambia. A point prevalence survey was conducted at the five FLHs in Lusaka using the Global-PPS<sup>®</sup> protocol. Hospital ASP core elements evaluated included hospital leadership commitment, accountability, pharmacy expertise, action, tracking, reporting, and education. Antibiotic use prevalence was 79.8% (146/183). A total of 220 antibiotic prescription encounters were recorded among inpatients, with ceftriaxone (J01DD04, Watch) being the most (50.0%) prescribed. Over 90.0% (202) of the antibiotic prescriptions targeted suspected community-acquired infections, but only 36.8% (81) were compliant with national treatment guidelines. ASP core element implementation was 36.0% (16.2/45), with only two hospitals achieving over 50.0%. The most deficient core elements were accountability, action, tracking, and reporting. ASP implementation in Zambia's FLHs providing PHC was sub-optimal, with high antibiotic prescribing rates, frequent use of broad-spectrum Watch group antibiotics, and low compliance with national treatment guidelines. As key ways forward, ASPs in Zambia's PHC require strengthening by adapting the WHO AWaRe recommendations and improving accountability, actions, tracking, and reporting antibiotic use to improve stewardship practice and reduce AMR.",

        "abstract": "The clinical management of HIV, particularly in the context of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and co-infections such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), is notably complex. Here we present a case study of a patient with multi-drug resistant HIV who was co-infected with drug-resistant HBV and suffered from renal insufficiency. We employed an optimized regimen based on the fusion inhibitor Albuvirtide (ABT), combined with highly effective, low nephrotoxicity antiviral drugs for HBV. This approach ultimately achieved effective suppression of both HIV and HBV. A 58-year-old male, diagnosed with HIV in 1997 and co-infected with HBV, experienced renal insufficiency. Due to poor adherence, he developed resistance to nucleoside, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors over nearly two decades, necessitating frequent modifications to his ART regimen. In 2019, HIV RNA rebounded to 1120 copies/mL, prompting resistance testing that revealed high-level resistance to Elvitegravir (EVG), intermediate resistance to Raltegravir (RAL), and potential low-level resistance to Bictegravir (BIC) and dolutegravir (DTG). This led to a strategic overhaul of the ART to ABT + Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide (FTC/TAF) + double-dose DTG, resulting in a significant suppression of the HIV. Concurrently, HBV suppression and renal function were well-maintained. This case underscores the potential value of individualized treatment strategies for patients with multidrug-resistant HIV and HBV co-infection complicated by renal impairment. The observed virological control following the use of novel agents such as Albuvirtide (ABT), in combination with second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) like DTG, alongside renal-sparing antivirals, highlights the importance of designing optimized regimens based on resistance profiles and renal function. This personalized and adaptive therapeutic approach may offer clinical benefits in similarly complex scenarios.",

This current study determined the prevalence of bloodstream bacterial isolates and their antibiotic-resistant patterns at the Holy Family Hospital, Nkawkaw, Ghana, spanning a six-year period. A hospital-based retrospective study was carried out to review records of bacterial isolates of bloodstream infections and their antibiotic-resistant pattern among patients who visited the Holy Family Hospital between 2018 and 2023. The data was collected into an Excel sheet version 2021, cleaned, and exported to the appropriate statistical software, SPSS v26 for statistical analysis. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses. Of 3,228 records in this study, the majority (66.0%) were found to be under 1 year of age, while 18.6% were aged 1-10 years. The prevalence of bacteraemia was 8.7% (95% CI: 7.8-9.7%). Klebsiella species was found to be the most prevalent at 30.2%, followed by S. aureus (26.0%). The highest levels of antibiotic resistance were detected against tetracycline (94.5%), penicillin (92.3%), and chloramphenicol (90.9%). Also, significant resistance was also found against vancomycin (88.3%), cefuroxime (86.5%), and cloxacillin (84.4%). Conversely, amikacin demonstrated the highest susceptibility rate (90.5%), followed by ciprofloxacin (75.0%). The study highlights the significant public health burden posed by bacteraemia and the growing challenge of antibiotic resistance. The prevalence of bacteraemia, particularly caused by Gram-negative organisms such as Klebsiella species and E. coli underscores the need for targeted interventions to improve infection control in healthcare settings.",

        "abstract": "To explore urologists' perceptions of barriers to, and facilitators of, adherence to international antimicrobial prophylaxis (AP) guidelines for endourological procedures in Jordan and to identify strategies to optimise guideline-concordant AP prescribing. The present study is a qualitative study undertaken through semi-structured interviews and inductive thematic analysis. Study results are reported per Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. Secondary and tertiary care across multiple public, private and academic hospitals in Jordan. Nineteen practising urologists (all male; median age 32 years, IQR 8; nine residents, 10 specialists) who routinely prescribe AP for endourological procedures. Participants were recruited via convenience snowball sampling and interviewed until thematic saturation was reached. Not applicable. The main outcomes were themes describing perceived barriers to guideline adherence and potential facilitators to support appropriate AP use. Participants identified several barriers: (1) patient level, strong expectations for antibiotics post-procedure and concerns about procedure-site hygiene; (2) clinician level, fear of postoperative infections and litigation, lack of familiarity with updated guidance and doubts about applying international guidelines locally; (3) system level, hierarchical prescribing dynamics, referral communication gaps, high workloads and time pressures, and concerns over sterilisation practices. Facilitators included targeted professional training and regular guideline updates for urologists, development of local AP guidelines informed by local resistance data, enhanced patient education campaigns and active involvement of clinical pharmacists in preoperative antibiotic review and auditing. Urologists in Jordan face multifaceted barriers to AP guideline adherence. Future stewardship programmes can use insights from this study to develop locally tailored guidelines, targeted clinician training and pharmacist-led audits. Pilot testing with metrics such as prescribing rates, guideline concordance, antibiotic consumption and postoperative infection incidence will be essential to validate their impact before wider implementation.",

        "abstract": "With increasing life expectancy, the incidence of degenerative and inflammatory joint diseases continues to rise. These conditions are major indications for orthopedic prostheses, which pose risks of postoperative complications, particularly infections of orthopedic prostheses (IPO). Dental infections have been considered a potential source of these infections, and recommendations regarding the use of antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) during dental procedures have evolved over time. Current guidelines discourage the routine use of AP. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of private-sector dentists in the cities of Rabat, Temara, and Salé (Morocco) regarding the dental management of patients with orthopedic prostheses, particularly the use of AP. An anonymous 21-question survey was distributed to 310 dentists practicing in these cities. The collected responses were analyzed using JamoviR software (version 2.3.25), with a significance threshold set at p < 0.05. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were employed to compare different groups. Out of 310 distributed questionnaires, 102 valid responses were retained (response rate: 32.9%). Among respondents, 53.9% considered patients with joint prostheses at risk of infection, yet only 47.1% reported prescribing AP. Female practitioners and those with over 20 years of experience were significantly more likely to prescribe AP (p=0.047 and p=0.002, respectively). Dentists who did not consult guidelines or attend professional conferences were also more prone to prescribing AP during endodontic procedures (p=0.017 and p=0.018). This study reveals inconsistent knowledge and practices among dentists regarding AP use for patients with joint prostheses. Given the misalignment with current guidelines and the influence of outdated sources of information, targeted educational interventions and updated clinical guidelines are urgently needed to promote evidence-based practices. Clear, standardized guidelines are also essential to prevent the unjustified overprescription of antibiotics and to address the growing concern of antimicrobial resistance.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. To improve the clinical outcomes of neonates with sepsis, treatment should be based on bacteriological identification and antibiotic susceptibility. This study aims to assess the proportion of culture-positive gram-negative bacteria (GNB), the antibiotic susceptibility patterns, and treatment outcomes of neonatal sepsis at two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in Addis Ababa. A retrospective observational study was conducted among gram-negative sepsis suspected neonates admitted at Zewditu Memorial Hospital and Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital NICUs from January to December 2023. All neonates who were suspected of having sepsis were included in this study. Standard microbiological culture and biochemical tests were used to identify bacterial species and the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion assay using Mueller-Hinton agar was employed to test the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates as per Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute guidelines. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study variables. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify the factors associated with the treatment outcomes of neonatal sepsis. A p-value < 0.05 was set for statistical significance. A total of 933 neonates were diagnosed with sepsis during the study period, of which 166 neonates were enrolled in the study for gram-negative sepsis: 84 (51%) were female and 97 (58%) had early onset sepsis. The median length of hospital stay was nine days with interquartile range of 16 days. The predominant GNB identified was Klebsiella spp. (n = 89; 49%), followed by Acinetobacter spp. (n = 38; 21%) and Escherichia coli (n = 19; 11%). In both hospitals, Klebsiella spp. was resistant to most of the routinely prescribed antibiotics: (n = 68; 89%) were resistant to ceftriaxone, (n = 56, 89%) cefepime and (n = 60; 75%) to gentamicin. Lower rates of resistance were recorded for other antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin (n = 12; 18%), ertapenem (n = 11; 16%), meropenem (n = 9; 13%), and amikacin (n = 3; 4%). A total of 92 (55%) neonates with the GNB isolated in the current study had multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms. The study found that newborns with MDR infections were five times more likely to experience poor treatment outcomes compared to those with non-resistant strains (AOR, 5.23 95% CI [2.59, 11.11]). In addition, newborns who stayed less than seven days, compared to those who spent seven or more days in the hospital was four times (AOR: 4.16, 95% CI (2.0-9.01) more likely to experience poor health outcomes. Klebsiella spp. was the most common GNB isolated from the NICUs. More than half neonatal sepsis was caused by MDR organisms and associated with significant poor treatment outcomes. high prevalence of MDR-gram-negative bacteremia is alarming and highlights the need for the implementation of routine surveillance and infection control measures to decrease morbidity and mortality and to combat the development of antimicrobial resistance.",

        "abstract": "Background Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is a highly transformable strict human pathogen with the potential to evolve into a 'superbug' Resource-limited settings like ours rely on the syndromic diagnostic approach recommended by the WHO and adopted by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) for the management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The 'Grey kit\" comprising of cefixime 400 mg and azithromycin 1 gm is recommended for genitourinary discharge in India. Aim The objective of this study was to examine putative changes in minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) of ceftriaxone/cefixime and azithromycin during a ∼15-year period to assess the need for dosage adjustment. Methods All clinical isolates of NG obtained from patients attending the STI clinic of our hospital were included in the study. The MIC for penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefixime, azithromycin, and spectinomycin was determined using the E-test method. The results were interpreted according to the Calibrated Dichotomous Sensitivity (CDS) criteria except for azithromycin (up to 2011) and cefixime, where Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines were used. We analysed our data by years (2008-2012 vs. 2013-2017) and examined the limited data available thereafter until June 2023 (in light of COVID). MIC50 and MIC90 (MIC values that stop the growth of 50% and 90% of bacterial isolates respectively) data were analysed for determination of MIC creep. Results A total of 183 NG isolates were collected during the study period (151 during 2008-2017 and 32, 2018 onwards). All isolates were from male patients presenting with urethritis. High resistance levels were observed for penicillin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin, but decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone or cefixime remained (<10%), as did resistance to azithromycin (<5%). Notably, no ceftriaxone resistance was detected over the ∼15-year period, and no significant increase in MIC (MIC creep) was observed for ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Only two isolates showed concurrent resistance to azithromycin and decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone. All isolates were susceptible to spectinomycin. Limitations The clinical isolates were obtained from a single site, and the numbers were limited. There is a paucity of data during the COVID-19 pandemic due to limited clinical services being offered. Conclusion There appears to be no immediate threat to the therapies currently being used in syndromic management for genitourinary discharge. However, MIC-based monitoring of crucial antimicrobials is imperative.",

        "abstract": "Introduction <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (KPC-CPE) are a significant cause of healthcare-associated infections, characterized by high-level resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and limited therapeutic options. This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological trends, clinical management, and mortality associated with KPC-CPE infections over a decade, highlighting variations in incidence and treatment patterns during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A retrospective, single-center cohort study was conducted at a tertiary Portuguese hospital, analyzing data from August 2015 to June 2024. Patients with microbiologically confirmed KPC-CPE infections were included in this study. Epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic data were extracted and analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression to identify risk factors for mortality. Results Among 6,259 patients with KPC-CPE isolates, 483 (7.7%) developed infections. Infection rates peaked in 2016 and 2023, with a decline during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 30-day mortality rate was 28%, with bloodstream infections (BSIs) (odds ratio {OR}=1.64, p=0.028) and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) significantly associated with increased mortality. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) were significantly more frequent in survivors (p=0.001). A shift from combination therapy to monotherapy, particularly with ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA), was observed, aligning with international guidelines. Patients who did not receive adequate antibiotic treatment had significantly higher mortality (OR=6.36, p<0.001). Monotherapy with aminoglycosides, ceftazidime-avibactam, tigecycline, co-trimoxazole (SXT), or fluoroquinolones was more common in survivors. Conversely, combination therapies involving high-dose meropenem (HD-MEM) or aminoglycosides were more common among non-survivors. Mortality was exceptionally high in 2019 and 2020, with no single explanatory factor identified. Conclusion Our study findings highlight the importance of rigorous infection control measures, the optimization of antimicrobial therapy, and the continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance. The growing reliance on monotherapy underscores the necessity of antimicrobial stewardship programs to prevent the development of resistance. Additional multicenter studies are needed to optimize therapeutic strategies and improve patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "International guidelines are available for the assessment and improvement of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes: an important strategy to address the escalating global antimicrobial resistance problem. However, existing AMS assessment tools lack contextual specificity for resource-limited settings, leading to limited applicability in Asia. This project aimed to identify relevant themes from current guidance documents to help develop a context-specific assessment tool that can be applied by healthcare facilities (HCFs) to improve local implementation.We performed a sequential approach of a scoping review to identify relevant assessment themes for Asia and an expert survey for getting feedback on the relevance of assessment stems developed from the scoping review. We reviewed English-language published documents discussing AMS implementation or assessment at HCFs globally and in Asia. Themes were derived through content analysis and classified following the predefined context dimensions to develop assessment stems, defined as containing one identified determinant that may influence implementation outcomes. The survey consisting of identified assessment stems was reviewed by 20 locally identified experts in Asia who rated the level of relevance of these stems in AMS implementation in the region.National leadership, training and technical support, and policy and guidance were the most commonly identified themes among 100 themes identified from 73 reviewed documents. From these themes, we developed 131 assessment stems for the expert survey. Of the 131 assessment stems, 117 (89%) were considered relevant for AMS implementation in Asia by at least 80% of respondents. These stems were included in the process of developing a global AMS assessment tool to support HCFs to improve their programmes.In conclusion, national leadership and support represent a distinct and important aspect affecting AMS implementation in HCFs in Asia. The identified assessment themes have substantial value for the formulation of locally relevant implementation strategies tailored to the Asian context.",

Observation of healthcare providers' clinical assessment, diagnosis and treatment; re-assessing children; interviewing caregivers and healthcare providers; and facility audit were applied to collect the data. Both descriptive and multilevel binary logistic regression analyses were done. Only 35.6% (95% CI: 33.2, 38.0) of sick children with pneumonia symptoms received the correct classification and treatment. Factors associated with accurate diagnostic classification and appropriate treatment included being a young infant (adjusted OR (AOR): 2.8, 95% CI: 1.4, 5.4), absence of fever (AOR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.0), longer consultation times (AOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.9), receiving care from healthcare providers who referred to the chart booklet during diagnosis and treatment (AOR: 3.9, 95% CI: 2.8, 5.4), taking the IMNCI training (AOR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.5, 3.7), lower patient caseloads (AOR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.6) and having regular review meetings on health services quality (AOR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.3, 2.5). The proportion of correct classification and treatment of sick children with pneumonia symptoms was low, leading to poor treatment outcomes, irrational use of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance. Almost all cluster-level associated factors are modifiable. Strengthening accountability, mentoring and implementing tailored strategies are crucial to enhancing healthcare providers' adherence to the IMNCI guidelines.",

        "abstract": "Pyloromyotomy is a clean surgical procedure with a low risk of surgical site infections (SSIs). Despite this, surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) is often administered, raising concerns about unnecessary antibiotic exposure and antimicrobial resistance. This study aims to evaluate whether SAP reduces SSI rates in infants undergoing pyloromyotomy for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and to propose a guideline for selective SAP omission. This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database. Infants undergoing pyloromyotomy between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2023 were included. The primary outcome was the occurrence of SSIs within 30 days postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included stratified rates of superficial, deep incisional, and organ/space SSIs. Among 4917 infants (age <1 year; 84.26 % male), 49.48 % received SAP. Additionally, 81 patients (1.65 %) received post-operative antibiotics beyond the intraoperative period. The overall SSI rate was 1.42 %, primarily comprised of superficial SSIs. There was no significant difference in SSI rates between infants receiving SAP (1.15 %) and those not receiving SAP (1.69 %) (p = 0.110). The rate of unplanned readmission and unplanned return to the operating room within 30 days was 2.44 % and 1.04 %, respectively, with no significant difference between those who received post-operative antibiotics and those who did not (p > 0.2 for both comparisons). Routine SAP administration in pyloromyotomy is unnecessary given the low risk of SSIs. SAP in ASA Class I or II infants undergoing isolated pyloromyotomy without mucosal perforation, immune-compromising conditions, infections, or trauma should be omitted. These findings support efforts to optimize antibiotic stewardship in pediatric surgical practice. Original Research Article. III.",

        "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), surveillance programs have become essential at national, regional, and global levels to adjust empirical treatments and target interventions to prevent and control the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Therefore, this study aimed to conduct the first systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical Enterobacterales resistance to 11 representative antimicrobials from the WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) list, and to provide recommendations to tackle AMR more efficiently in Togo. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (The PRISMA 2020) were used to conduct this study and the protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024606897). Keywords were used to conduct a systematic literature review of electronic databases. Data analysis was conducted using Stata software version 17.0. Twenty research articles reporting 9,327 clinical Enterobacterales isolates obtained from 1991 to 2020 were included in this review and were mainly Escherichia coli (6,639; 71.2%), and Klebsiella spp. (2,542; 27.3%), mainly isolated from urine (14 studies; 70%), and pus/wounds (12; 60%). The pooled Enterobacterales resistance rates ranged from 1% (95% CI: 0, 2) imipenem, 3% (95% CI: 1, 5) amikacin, 4% (95% CI: 2, 7) fosfomycin, 50% (95% CI: 40, 60) chloramphenicol, 55% (95% CI: 45, 64) gentamicin, 68% (95% CI: 59, 76) ciprofloxacin, 73% (95% CI: 66, 80) amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC), 79% (95% CI: 71, 86) third-generation cephalosporins (3GC), to 90% (95% CI: 86, 93) sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SXT). The most significant upward trend over 30 years was reported for SXT (R<sup>2</sup> = 73.24%, p < 0.001), ciprofloxacin (R<sup>2</sup> = 61.44%, p < 0.001), and 3GC (R<sup>2</sup> = 18.49%, p < 0.001). Klebsiella spp. strains were significantly more resistant to chloramphenicol (p = 0.03) than E. coli isolates, whereas E. coli isolates were significantly more resistant to amikacin (p = 0.04) than Klebsiella spp. isolates. This study revealed high first-line AMR rates with drastic upward trends in clinical Enterobacterales isolated in Togo over the past 30 years. Thus, the adjustment of empirical antimicrobial treatments in Togo becomes crucial. Moreover, the implementation of prevention policies, whole-genome sequencing approaches, and the promotion of antibiotic stewardship must be enhanced. Finally, alternative therapeutic approaches, such as phytotherapy and phage therapy, were discussed. Not applicable.",

This study aimed to describe perinatal TB, comprising congenital (cTB) and postnatal (pTB) TB, in a European setting. Retrospective cohort study via the Paediatric Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group (ptbnet) capturing and comparing cases of cTB and pTB diagnosed at 104 participating European healthcare institutions between 1995 and 2019. Forty-six cases reported by 20 centres were included in the final analysis (cTB, n = 27; pTB, n = 19). Median age at symptom onset was one week in cTB (IQR: 0-1 weeks), and 12 weeks in pTB patients (IQR: 5-18 weeks). Prematurity was more common in cTB than pTB patients [57.9% (11/19); 95% CI: 36.3-76.9% vs. 21.1% (4/19); 95% CI: 8.5-43.3%; p = 0.049], and the average birth weight was significantly lower [1680 g; IQR: 932-2805 g vs. 2890 g; IQR: 2461-3400 g; p = 0.0043]. Microbiological confirmation was achieved in most patients [85.2% (23/27); 95% CI: 67.5-94.1% vs. 78.9% (15/19); 95% CI: 56.7-91.5%; p = 0.70].

Four (4/46; 8.7%) patients died, and four (4/46; 8.7%) had severe long-term sequelae. There was substantial mortality and morbidity in this patient cohort, despite the high-resource setting. cTB was associated with premature birth and low birth weight. In contrast to microbiological tests, immunological tests perform poorly in perinatal TB, and should therefore not be used as rule-out tests. No study-specific funding.",

        "abstract": "Over the years, the clinical management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is continuously evolving as a challenge because of resistance to antibiotics. In addition to investigating the nature of antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics, this study will investigate the age and gender nature of patients having these resistances. Patients who were prescribed urine culture sensitivity tests as part of their treatment at a tertiary-level hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, were included as a sample. Urine culture was done following the guidelines of CLSI, and a sensitivity test was done following the Kirby-Bauer sensitivity method. About 55% of both males and females have been found to be infected with <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and about 15% were infected with <i>Klebsiella</i>. Other pathogens detected are <i>Enterococcus</i> and <i>Candida</i>. Age and gender nature of <i>E. coli</i> indicates that females are more infected below the age of 60 years, while males are more infected above this age. <i>E. coli</i> has exhibited the least resistance to Azithromycin, Netilmicin, and Amikacin. The resistance to Ciprofloxacin shows that females are more resistant until the age of 60 years, and males after that. Multidrug resistance shows an alarming result that about 20% of infected patients are resistant to nine antibiotics. This study clearly indicates that UTI is a continuously evolving problem, and its investigation should remain a continuous process. Because of economic and social practices in Bangladesh, urinary tract infection is a continually evolving disease. The treatment requires relatively updated information about the behavior of the pathogens causing this infection. There is not sufficient information in Bangladesh about the age and gender nature of the infected patients, the infected pathogens, and their antibiotic resistance. Moreover, because of indiscriminate and uncontrolled use of antibiotics within the country, the nature of multidrug resistance of these pathogens is also important for the effective management of these patients. This research attempts to address these issues.",

        "abstract": "Historically, the management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was centered on antibiotics. However, modern theories regarding the pathogenesis of diverticulitis have challenged the notion that antibiotics are necessary in all cases. Despite major reform in many societal guidelines, the adoption of non-antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated diverticulitis has been limited, especially in North America. The purpose of this SAGES White Paper was to review the available evidence on antibiotic omission in uncomplicated diverticulitis and to explore methods of safe implementation. A task force within the SAGES Colorectal Surgery Committee was formed to work on this White Paper. The committee and its leadership approved an outline that would focus on the following topics: (1) Defining the problem with unnecessary antibiotic exposure; (2) Evaluating the evidence on antibiotic omission in uncomplicated diverticulitis; (3) Identifying the appropriate patient for antibiotic omission; (4) Outlining how to counsel patients who are treated without antibiotics; (5) Reviewing methods to safely implement this practice in both the hospital and community setting. These topics were divided up among members of the task force who performed a structured literature search in preparation for their assignments. Antibiotics are associated with several patient and societal adverse effects, including the rising problem of antimicrobial resistance. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated no superiority to the routine administration of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Appropriate patients for antibiotic omission include those who are immunocompetent, non-septic, and have mild symptoms/disease severity on imaging. Existing frameworks for the safe implementation of new practices can be referenced to help increase adoption of non-antibiotic therapy. The existing body of evidence supports antibiotic omission in appropriate cases of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. In order to increase the widespread adoption of this practice, buy-in from key stakeholders (both healthcare professionals and patients) is necessary.",

        "abstract": "Ear, nose and throat (ENT) infections are often associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Antibiotic overuse and misuse for most ENT infections have been reported, caused by a lack of expertise or uncertainties to distinguish between infection types. This study sought to determine the level of appropriateness of antibiotics for ENT infections and its associated factors in ambulatory care in a teaching hospital in Ghana to guide future policies given rising resistance rates. A retrospective cross-sectional study design was undertaken to audit the quality of antibiotic use in Ho Teaching Hospital, a leading teaching hospital in Ghana, between January 2022 to December 2022. A checklist was designed to extract patient socio-demographic and clinical information from electronic medical records. The main study outcome was the appropriate choice of antibiotics principally in accordance to the Ghana standard treatment guidelines. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed on the data collected using STATA version 14. The electronic medical records of a total of 3,279 patients were extracted. The majority (57.88%, n = 1898) of patients were females, median (inter-quartile range) age was 25 [7-42] years. Ear infections were the commonest (66.24%, n = 2172) diagnosed ENT infection, followed by throat infections (15.74%, n = 516). The most prescribed antibiotic was oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid together with a topical neomycin-steroid combination (28.00%, n = 918), followed by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid alone (18.69%, n = 613). The appropriate choice of antibiotic for all ENT infections in accordance with treatment guidelines was 60.11%. Inappropriate use of antibiotics was high when more than one antibiotic and World Health Organisation (WHO) 'Watch' group antibiotics were prescribed and ear infections compared to the nose and throat infections were treated. The appropriateness of antibiotic use for ENT infections in this hospital was suboptimal. It was predicted by the type of infection, the number of antibiotics prescribed and the WHO AWaRe group. Antimicrobial stewardship interventions such as clinical audit with feedback and clinician education must be enhanced to among other things identify antibiotic use gaps to help reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics for ENT infections.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate the prevalence and outcomes of carbapenem de-escalation among hospitalized urinary tract infection (UTI) patients at Jordan University Hospital from January 2022 to March 2024. This retrospective study included adult patients who received carbapenems as empirical therapy and underwent urine culture testing. Patients who were discharged before culture results (n = 31) were excluded. The primary outcome was to assess the rate of effective de-escalation, which is the transition to a narrower-spectrum antibiotic without therapeutic failure. Secondary outcomes included the effect on successful de-escalation on patients' hospital length of stay, and the relationship between urine culture results and the success of de-escalation. When determining whether to de-escalate, factors such as clinical stability, and urine culture results and susceptibility were considered. Chi-square test assessed associations between culture results and de-escalation success. A total of 205 patients who received carbapenems as empirical therapy and underwent urine culture testing were included in the study. Out of these, 116 individuals (56.6%) had negative culture results, indicating no infection, while 89 individuals (43.4%) tested positive, confirming the presence of an infection. Among these patients, 95.6% (196 out of 205) required de-escalation of their treatment, whereas 4.4% did not. The prevalence of successful de-escalation was 40.3% (79 out of 196). The analysis revealed that successful de-escalation is much more likely in cases with urine cultures showing growth (86.8%) compared to those with no growth (17.2%) (p = 0.001). The study also indicated no significant differences in the length of hospital stay between the successfully de-escalated group and those who failed or were incorrectly de-escalated (P > 0.05). The study underscores the challenges of implementing effective antibiotic stewardship in UTI management, particularly regarding carbapenem de-escalation. Enhanced protocols and clinician education are essential to optimize de-escalation practices, especially in cases with negative microbiological results. Further research is needed to refine these strategies and address the growing issue of antibiotic resistance in UTIs.",

While the benefits of SDD have been documented in this population, it remains unclear whether burn patients, who are at increased risk of infection and have distinct clinical characteristics, may experience similar benefits. In this systematic review we aimed to assess the desirable and undesirable patient-important effects of administering SDD to burn patients. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of SDD versus placebo or no SDD in burn patients. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included serious adverse events, antimicrobial resistance, pneumonia, blood stream infections, ICU- and hospital-free days, and 90-day mortality. We searched all major databases and followed the recommendations provided by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The certainty of evidence was assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. We identified four RCTs with a total of 457 burn patients. All trials were assessed as having either 'some concerns' or 'high risk' of bias. The evidence was found to be very uncertain across all outcomes assessed. For mortality, the relative risk (RR) was 0.62 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.22-1.78, I<sup>2</sup> = 75 %, random-effects model (REM), very low certainty evidence). For pneumonia, the RR was 0.75 (95 % CI 0.48-1.19, I<sup>2</sup> = 0 %, fixed-effect model, very low certainty evidence). For bloodstream infections, the RR was 1.10 (95 % CI 0.71-1.69, I<sup>2</sup> = 0 %, REM, very low certainty evidence). For hospital length of stay, the mean difference was -2.03 days (95 % CI -9.64-5.59, I<sup>2</sup> = 51 %, REM, very low certainty evidence). We did not perform meta-analyses for the remaining secondary outcomes due to limited or no data. Trial sequential analysis could not be performed due to insufficient number of total participants and events in the included trials. We found that the certainty of evidence is very low about the effects of SDD on patient-important outcomes in burn patients. Extrapolating from the evidence on mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients may be reasonable until more data from RCTs in burn patients emerge.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial misuse in surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) can include the inappropriate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or prolonged dosing. In 2021, a pilot antimicrobial stewardship programme (ASP) was launched in Georgia, which involved developing and adapting SAP guidelines, establishing an interprofessional SAP prescribing approach, collecting surgical site infection (SSI) data via routinely collected data and telephonic patient follow-ups, and providing surgical unit staff with prescribing feedback and training on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). ASP introduction was staggered across ten hospitals over three years. This study explored behavioural determinants of surgical teams' ASP uptake in five hospitals where the ASP was introduced or about to be introduced. Findings primarily concerned epidemiologists' and nurses' ASP-related behaviour. Those at ASP non-introduced hospitals were less involved in the SAP prescribing process, had lower AMR awareness, and lacked professional development opportunities. Those at ASP-introduced hospitals exhibited higher AMR knowledge and felt ASP participation boosted confidence, facilitated work, and furnished key professional development. Results indicate interprofessional collaboration on SAP prescribing supported ASP uptake across teams, and investment in health worker training and administrative encouragement ensured effective ASP participation and implementation. Findings highlight the crucial role of epidemiologists in SAP and illustrate a need for developing Georgian nurses' AMR competencies as a vehicle to address public AMR knowledge gaps. Longer-term ASP uptake will need to consider the regulatory context in which hospitals lack access to national-level SSI data and feedback on SSI reporting but are fined for reporting non-compliance. Despite resource limitations and a small sample size, the study engaged all pilot ASP health workers. Respondents' inexperience of qualitative research participation and ensuant hesitation limited exploration of motivational factors supporting health workers' ASP uptake, which could be explored in further research.",

        "abstract": "In 2022, approximately 56.5% of adults and 47.1% of children and adolescents were affected by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in Africa, and clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori (CRHp) strains have become global priority pathogens. Therefore, this study aimed to conduct the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of CRHp in Africa. This investigation was conducted according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (The PRISMA 2020). Literature search of electronic databases (Google Scholar, African Journals Online, ResearchGate, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus) was performed using keywords \"clarithromycin\", \"Helicobacter pylori\", \"African country name\", \"mutation in the 23S rRNA\". Sixty-five studies involving 5,313 H. pylori strains isolated over 26 years (1997-2022) from 23 African countries were included in this study. The samples from which CRHp was isolated included gastric biopsy (60/63; 95%), and stool (4/63; 6%). The pooled prevalence of CRHp in Africa was 27% (95% CI: 22, 33). There was a steady trend in the prevalence of CRHp isolated in Africa over the 26 years (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.0001, p = 0.92, slope coefficient of -0.05x). Ten types of 23S rRNA mutations (conferring clarithromycin resistance) were identified, and included mainly A2143G (465 H. pylori strains out of 1178 tested) and A2142G (344 H. pylori strains out of 1027). To enhance the accuracy and validity of surveillance data for H. pylori in Africa, there is an urgent need for implementing standardized microbiological methods for resistance detection. The prevalence of CRHp reported in this study was very similar to the overall global prevalence and there is a need for more representative studies on CRHp in Africa. While waiting for this, the treatment of H. pylori infections must be based on the guidelines of the AHMSG first Lagos consensus.",

        "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> The discovery of antibiotics revolutionized healthcare by significantly reducing morbidity and mortality. However, excessive and inappropriate use has led to a global surge in antimicrobial resistance, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to evaluate antibiotic use patterns among inpatients at Jimma Medical Center (JMC) in Southwest Ethiopia. <b>Methods:</b> A longitudinal observational study was conducted in February and March 2019 at JMC, focusing on patients admitted for over 24 h who received antibiotics. Data on patient demographics, clinical indications, and antibiotics prescribed were systematically collected. Antibiotic consumption rates were measured as days of therapy (DOTs) per 100 patient-days, and utilization was classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework. <b>Results:</b> A total of 384 inpatients were included, with a male predominance (53.9%) and a median age of 24 years (IQR: 5-37). In total, 634 antibiotic regimens were prescribed. According to the WHO AWaRe classification, 48.3% (306/634) were \"Access\" and 51.7% (328/634) were \"Watch\" antibiotics. Patients were treated with antibiotics for a median duration of 4 days (IQR: 2-7), leading to a total of 2880 days of antibiotic therapy. Ceftriaxone was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic, with a usage rate of 44.65 DOTs per 100 patient-days. Substantial variability was observed in empirical antibiotic regimens among treating physicians and across wards. Culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) were performed for only 4.2% of patients, and none of the treatments were modified based on susceptibility data. <b>Conclusions:</b> The study highlights critical issues in antibiotic prescribing at JMC, including over-reliance on \"Watch\" antibiotics, predominantly ceftriaxone, limited use of AST results, and deviations from standard treatment guidelines. Addressing these challenges requires implementing antimicrobial stewardship programs, developing evidence-based local treatment guidelines, and strengthening and encouraging the use of microbiology services to improve rational antibiotic use.",

        "abstract": "MRSA represents a significant public health challenge, particularly in resource-constrained regions like Africa. A critical factor in its spread is the role of asymptomatic carriers, who not only facilitate transmission but also face a markedly higher risk of developing MRSA-related infections. Against this backdrop, the current meta-analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of MRSA colonization rates, associated risk factors, and antibiotic resistance profiles across African populations. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across African Journals Online, African Index Medicus, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2025. Eligible studies reported on MRSA colonization rates, associated risk factors, or antibiotic resistance patterns within African populations. Results were presented as pooled prevalence or risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals, employing a random-effects model in R software (meta package). A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study followed the PRISMA guidelines throughout. Sixty-nine studies with 23,484 participants from 16 African countries were included. Subgroup analyses identified Healthcare Workers and hospitalized patients as having the highest pooled prevalence at 13.6% and 12.9%, respectively. Conversely, lower prevalence rates were observed among healthy community residents and children, at 4.1% and 4.7%, respectively. Among HCWs, Egypt reported the highest MRSA colonization rate at 18.1%. Key risk factors for MRSA colonization include a history of hospitalization (RR: 2.2), prior antibiotic use (RR: 1.4), diabetes mellitus (RR: 4.4), HIV with CD4 < 200 cells/µL (RR: 2.8), invasive procedures (RR: 4.8), and being a nurse compared to a physician (RR: 1.8), all with p < 0.05. Antibiotic resistance of MRSA was low for linezolid (2.7%) and vancomycin (5.9%), but higher for mupirocin (10.7%), clindamycin (23.6%), and Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (38.9%). MRSA colonization is a significant public health challenge in Africa, particularly among healthcare workers and hospitalized patients. Implementing targeted interventions for these high-risk groups can effectively reduce MRSA transmission and overall infection burden. Continuous monitoring is essential, especially given the resistance to mupirocin, a key antibiotic used for MRSA decolonization.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Escherichia coli, particularly extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (ESBL-EC), is a global public health concern. Bacteriophages (phages) play a significant role in bacterial evolution and the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study investigates prophages integrated within ESBL-EC genomes to assess their diversity, gene content, and potential contributions to ESBL-EC persistence across human, animal, and environmental reservoirs. Between May and December 2020, a cross-sectional study was conducted in Abuja and Lagos, collecting 448 stool, cecal, and environmental samples from abattoir workers, slaughtered cattle, and the abattoir environment. ESBL-EC genomes from these samples, obtained in an earlier study, were analyzed for phage regions using PHASTER. Intact prophages were analyzed in silico using computational tools to detect ARGs, ESBL genes, virulence factors, and heavy metal resistance. Their genomic relationships were examined with statistical significance of p < 0.05. Out of 448 samples, ESBL-EC prevalence was 21.7% (97/448). Among 97 ESBL-EC isolates, 646 prophage regions were detected, with 30% (194/646) classified as intact phages. Among the 158 phages with genus assignments, Punavirus was the most prevalent (60.1%). Escherichia was the most frequent predicted host (308/646), particularly in cattle (n = 143) and human (n = 124) sources. Among ESBL-EC genomes, 83.5% (81/97) with intact phages carried phage-associated ARGs, 76.3% (74/97) carried phage-associated ESBL genes, 18.6% (18/97) harbored phage-associated virulence factors, 15.5% (15/97) contained phage-associated plasmids, and 10.3% (10/97) had heavy metal resistance. The most prevalent phage-associated ARGs detected were qnrS1 (73/81) and bla<sub>CTX-M-15</sub> (72/81). Two isolates recovered from abattoir workers carried two phage-like plasmids, each harboring either tet(A) or bla<sub>CTX-M-55</sub> gene. The predominant phage lifestyles were temperate (n = 182), mainly in the Peduoviridae family, and lytic (n = 12) in the Punavirus genus. This is the first study in Nigeria to characterize phages in ESBL-EC isolates at the One Health interface. The presence of intact phages in humans, animals, and the environment underscores the complex interactions shaping phage ecology. The discovery of ARGs, virulence genes, and heavy metal resistance within prophages suggests a potential role in AMR dissemination. Future research should focus on elucidating mechanisms of ARG transfer mediated by phages in One Health settings.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial use in animals is one of the major drivers for the emergence and spread of resistant microorganisms. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) can spread from animals to humans and vice versa. However, there is scanty data on antimicrobial consumption in livestock in low and middle income countries especially Uganda. Monitoring antimicrobial consumption and use (AMCU) in the veterinary sector is important to identify areas of overuse and misuse and to design targeted interventions to reduce the need for unintentional exposure. This study aimed to quantify and characterize by pharmacological class the antimicrobials intended for use in animals in different livestock production systems imported annually in Uganda. We extracted data from the Uganda National Drug Authority (NDA) database on antimicrobials imported intended for veterinary use from 2018 to 2020. We analysed the quantities of the active pharmaceutical ingredient using the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) methodology and reported the consumption in kilograms and tonnes. For our study period from 2018 to 2020; 210,419 kg, 150,032 kg and 142,069 kg of antimicrobials for animal use were imported into the country respectively with annual average importation of 167,507 kg (167.6 tons). Antibacterials accounted for 82% and antiprotozoals accounted for 18% of the total quantities over the three years. Oxytetracycline was the top most consumed antibacterial. The top five pharmacological classes were tetracyclines (22.5 tons, 44.8%), aminogylcosides + penicillin combination (15.3 tons, 29.7%), sulfonamides and trimethoprim (6.14 tons, 12.4%), macrolides (1.88 tons, 3.9%) and fluoroquinolones (1.676 tons, 3.5%). 97% (97%) of the antibacterials were from the WHO Veterinary Critically Important Antimicrobials, 57.1% were from the WHO Highly Important Antimicrobials group, 32.1% were from the Critically Important Antimicrobials group and 10.7% were from the Highest Priority group. The European Medicines Agency AMEG analysis revealed that 57.1% were from the lowest risk (D) category, 36.5% were from the intermediate risk (C) category and 6.5% were from the restricted use (B) category. This study provides baseline data on the national-level consumption of antimicrobials used in animal health in different livestock production systems in Uganda for future reference. Annual quantification and analysis of veterinary AMCU should continue to inform monitoring distribution and use in relationship to livestock population numbers and the burden of diseases. Antimicrobial stewardship and pharmacovigilance activities in the animal health sector should focus on raising awareness to adhering to national and international guidance for appropriate and prudent use of antimicrobial agents.",

This study aimed to assess whether antibiotics for common infections are prescribed in a risk-based manner and how this changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.DesignCohort study of common infections and antibiotic prescribing.SettingWith the approval of NHS England, we accessed pseudonymised patient-level electronic health records of primary care data from The Phoenix Partnership through OpenSAFELY.ParticipantsWe included adults registered at general practices in England with a record of common infection, including lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and lower urinary tract infection (UTI), from January 2019 to March 2023. Patients with a record of COVID-19 were excluded.Main outcome measuresPatient-specific risks of infection-related hospital admission were estimated for each infection using risk prediction scores for patients who were not prescribed an antibiotic. The infection cohorts were then grouped into risk deciles, and probabilities of being prescribed an antibiotic were assessed.ResultsWe found 15,719,750 diagnoses of common infections. Of them, 450,215 (2.86%) were hospitalised in the 30 days after the diagnosis and 10,429,060 (66.34%) were prescribed an antibiotic. There were substantial differences in observed rates of hospital admissions between the lowest and highest risk deciles (25-fold difference in URTI). The probability of being prescribed an antibiotic for LRTI or UTI was unrelated to hospital admission risk, and that for URTI was weakly related to hospital admission risk. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of risk-based antibiotic prescribing reduced.ConclusionsThere is a need to better target antibiotics in primary care to patients with worse prognosis and strengthen treatment guidelines in personalisation of prescribing.",

This study aims to evaluate the survival rate of early appropriate therapy with polymyxin B (PMB), and adverse drug reactions of PMB in treating severe burn sepsis caused by CR-GNB infections. We retrospectively analyzed 72 patients with severe burn sepsis caused by CR-GNB infections from January 1, 2018, to December 30, 2023. These patients received a treatment regimen based on PMB for at least three days. We collected data on the patient's clinical characteristics, microbiological results, details of PMB treatment, adverse drug reactions with PMB, and mortality. We compared the 30-day mortality rates between patients who received early appropriate therapy (the timely administration of an active antimicrobial agent within 48 h after the onset of infection) and those who underwent non-early appropriate therapy, multivariate Cox regression analysis was employed to evaluate factors impacting the 30-day survival rate of patients, and the adverse drug reactions caused by PMB were also analyzed. Among the 72 patients with severe burn sepsis, the clinical effective rate was 69.4% (50/72), the 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 31.9% (23/72) and the 30-day sepsis-associated mortality rate was 27.8% (20/72). The adverse drug reactions of PMB included nephrotoxicity and skin pigmentation, with an incidence of 19.4% (14/72) and 15.3% (11/72), respectively. The patients who received early appropriate therapy had a lower mortality rate, lower SOFA scores and more wound infections compared to those who underwent non-early appropriate therapy (all P < 0.05). The univariate Cox regression analysis showed that age, hypertension, SOFA score at the time of sepsis diagnosis, and early appropriate therapy with PMB were associated with both 30-day all-cause mortality and sepsis-associated mortality in severely burned patients (all P < 0.05). Additionally, In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, early appropriate therapy with PMB was identified as an independent protective factor for both 30-day all-cause mortality (HR = 0.183 [95% CI 0.071-0.468], P < 0.001) and sepsis-associated mortality (HR = 0.150 [95% CI 0.054-0.414], P < 0.001) in severely burned patients.

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a global health threat, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas system technology offers a promising tool to combat AMR by targeting and disabling resistance genes in WHO bacterial priority pathogens. Thus, we systematically reviewed the potential of CRISPR-Cas technology to address AMR. This systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the Scopus and PubMed databases, focusing on publications from 2014 to June 2024. Keywords included \"CRISPR/Cas,\" \"antimicrobial resistance,\" and \"pathogen.\" The eligibility criteria required original studies involving CRISPR/Cas systems that targeted AMR. Data were extracted from eligible studies, qualitatively synthesized, and assessed for bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI)-standardized tool. Data from 48 eligible studies revealed diverse CRISPR-Cas systems, including CRISPR-Cas9, CRISPR-Cas12a, and CRISPR-Cas3, targeting various AMR genes, such as blaOXA-232, blaNDM, blaCTX-M, ermB, vanA, mecA, fosA3, blaKPC, and mcr-1, which are responsible for carbapenem, cephalosporin, methicillin, macrolide, vancomycin, colistin, and fosfomycin resistance. Some studies have explored the role of CRISPR in virulence gene suppression, including enterotoxin genes, tsst1, and iutA in Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Delivery mechanisms include bacteriophages, nanoparticles, electro-transformation, and conjugative plasmids, which demonstrate high efficiency in vitro and in vivo. CRISPR-based diagnostic applications have demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity, with detection limits as low as 2.7 × 10<sup>2</sup> CFU/mL, significantly outperforming conventional methods. Experimental studies have reported significant reductions in resistant bacterial populations and complete suppression of the targeted strains. Engineered phagemid particles and plasmid-curing systems have been shown to eliminate IncF plasmids, cured plasmids carrying vanA, mcr-1, and blaNDM with 94% efficiency, and restore antibiotic susceptibility. Gene re-sensitization strategies have been used to restore fosfomycin susceptibility in E. coli and eliminate blaKPC-2-mediated carbapenem resistance in MDR bacteria. Whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools have provided deeper insights into CRISPR-mediated defense mechanisms. Optimization strategies have significantly enhanced gene-editing efficiencies, offering a promising approach for tackling AMR in high-priority WHO pathogens. CRISPR-Cas technology has the potential to address AMR across priority WHO pathogens. While promising, challenges in optimizing in vivo delivery, mitigating potential resistance, and navigating ethical-regulatory barriers must be addressed to facilitate clinical translation.",

        "abstract": "Orthopedic wound infection is a difficult problem in the clinic. Accurate and rapid microbiological test results are essential for case management, antibiotic therapy, and infection control. We retrospectively evaluated 1285 specimens (puncture fluid, catheter, secretions, joint fluid, lavage fluid, extraction fluid, blood culture, drainage fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, bone, prosthesis tissue, etc.) from 739 patients who received orthopedic diagnosis and treatment, using routine conventional method (RCM)s as a reference method to evaluate the performance of multiplex PCR combined with capillary electrophoresis (mPCR-CE) for detecting pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes associated with bone infection. Among the 1285 samples analyzed, 1045 samples were consistent with the results of the RCM, with an agreement rate of 81.32%. Among the 155 inconsistent results, 13 (1.01%) were mPCR-CE negative but RCM positive, 142 (11.05%) was mPCR-CE positive but RCM negative. Compared with RCM, mPCR-CE demonstrated positive percentage and negative percentage agreement values of 65.37% and 98.35%, respectively. Moreover, the detection rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria by the mPCR-CE method was generally better than that by the RCM method. The detection rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by the mPCR-CE method is relatively high. The traditional drug-sensitive culture method is more inclined to detect extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). The mPCR-CE method has obvious advantages in terms of timeliness. This study revealed that mPCR-CE is a new and effective diagnostic method that can significantly reduce the identification time of bacterial identification and drug resistance, and has the potential to improve the management of orthopedic infections.",

        "abstract": "Bacteroides spp. are frequently detected in anaerobic infections, with a mortality rate of 50 % attributed to inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Recently, Bacteroides spp. have shown increased resistance to metronidazole (MNZ) and carbapenems. Therefore, identifying appropriate drugs for treating infections caused by Bacteroides spp. is necessary. Hence, this meta-analysis aimed to compare the clinical efficacy of combination therapy with MNZ versus carbapenems for the treatment of infections due to Bacteroides spp. Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, and Ichushi databases were searched for relevant articles that met the inclusion criteria through October 2024. Clinical efficacy was defined as the percentage of patients who achieved complete resolution or remarkable improvement in all signs and symptoms of the infection; therefore, no additional antibiotics or procedures were necessary, and the percentage of eradication of Bacteroides spp. Of the 482 citations identified for screening, five studies with a total of 306 patients were enrolled. All included studies were randomized clinical trials, two were open-label studies, and three were double-blind studies. All the included patients had intra-abdominal infections (IAIs). The combined therapy with MNZ was comparable with the carbapenem group in clinical efficacy in the treatment of infections due to Bacteroides spp. (risk rate 1.03, 95 % confidence interval 0.93-1.14). Combined therapy with MNZ could be an effective treatment option for infections caused by Bacteroides spp., similar to carbapenems.",

This was an observational, retrospective cohort study using patient-level data from Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Italy, Malawi, Nigeria, South Korea, Switzerland and Turkey from patients with pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome and/or sepsis, regardless of COVID-19 positivity, who were admitted to critical care units or COVID-19 specialized wards. The changes of antimicrobial prescription between pre-pandemic and pandemic were estimated using logistic or linear regression. Pandemic effects on month-wise antimicrobial usage were evaluated using interrupted time series analyses (ITSAs). Antimicrobials for which prescriptions significantly increased during the pandemic were as follows: meropenem in Bangladesh (95% CI: 1.94-4.07) with increased prescribed daily dose (PDD) (95% CI: 1.17-1.58) and Turkey (95% CI: 1.09-1.58), moxifloxacin in Bangladesh (95% CI: 4.11-11.87) with increased days of therapy (DOT) (95% CI: 1.14-2.56), piperacillin/tazobactam in Italy (95% CI: 1.07-1.48) with increased DOT (95% CI: 1.01-1.25) and PDD (95% CI: 1.05-1.21) and azithromycin in Bangladesh (95% CI: 3.36-21.77) and Brazil (95% CI: 2.33-8.42). ITSA showed a significant drop in azithromycin usage in India (95% CI: -8.38 to -3.49 g/100 patients) and South Korea (95% CI: -2.83 to -1.89 g/100 patients) after WHO guidelines v1 release and increased meropenem usage (95% CI: 93.40-126.48 g/100 patients) and moxifloxacin (95% CI: 5.40-13.98 g/100 patients) in Bangladesh and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim in India (95% CI: 0.92-9.32 g/100 patients) following the Delta variant emergence.

        "abstract": "<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) are defined as inflammatory diseases of the nose, sinuses, pharynx, larynx, or trachea. They are common in children. The prescription of antibiotics for the treatment of URIs became a relevant theme in the scientific literature in recent decades. One of the most important ways to deal with increasing antimicrobial resistance is rational antibiotic therapy. This study aimed to evaluate the tendencies of antibiotic prescribing practices for Lithuanian children with URIs from 2018 to 2022. We describe how many children with URIs were prescribed antibiotics, which antibiotics were used, and whether prescribing practices meet national guidelines. <b>Methods</b>: Secondary data, which were used in this observational study, were collected from the Lithuanian Compulsory Health Insurance Fund (CHIF) electronic records. The study population consisted of children aged between 0 and 18 years who visited their primary care doctors (pediatricians or family doctors) between January 2018 and December 2022 and were prescribed antibiotics for the treatment of URIs. <b>Results</b>: Between 2018 and 2022, there were 445,328 visits reported when antibiotics, which belong to the J01 group according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATC), were prescribed to children aged 0-18. In more than half of the visits (51.70%), children aged 0-5 were consulted. Penicillins were mostly prescribed for the treatment of acute nasopharyngitis. Macrolides were mostly used to treat acute laryngitis and tracheitis. Of all penicillin-class antibiotics, the most popular choice was amoxycillin. The primary choice of cephalosporin was cefadroxil, and the primary choice of macrolide was clarithromycin. <b>Conclusions</b>: During the period of 2018-2022, the number of prescriptions for antibiotics for URTIs decreased, but prescriptions for penicillin-class antibiotics increased in a relative manner. The most common diagnoses during these visits were acute tonsillitis and acute pharyngitis, and most antibiotic prescriptions were for children in the 0-5 age group. If Lithuania's National Recommendations on the Rational Use of Antibiotics were implemented during the analyzed period, the prescribing tendencies would not meet them.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the antibiotic resistance patterns of microorganisms isolated from intensive care unit (ICU) patients and evaluate their impact on mortality and length of ICU stay. Given the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens in critically ill patients, understanding their resistance profiles is crucial for optimizing empirical antibiotic therapy and improving patient outcomes. This retrospective study included 237 ICU patients admitted between 1 July 2022, and 1 January 2024. The initial culture growth results from blood and urine samples were analyzed. Microorganism identification was performed using VITEK 2 Compact and conventional bacteriological methods, while antibiotic susceptibility testing followed CLSI 2022 and EUCAST 2022 guidelines. A total of 237 ICU patients were included in this study. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) (44.3%), <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (<i>K. pneumoniae</i>) (35.0%), and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>P. aeruginosa</i>) (25.3%), <i>with Acinetobacter baumannii</i> (<i>A. baumannii</i>) (31.2%) being the most resistant pathogen. Among Gram-positive bacteria, <i>methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>MRSA</i>) (12.2%) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (<i>VRE</i>) (21.5%) were the most frequently identified multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. Regarding antimicrobial resistance, carbapenem resistance was highest in <i>A. baumannii</i> (55%), followed by <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (40%) and <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (30%). Additionally, ESBL-producing <i>E. coli</i> (43.2%) and <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (38.5%), as well as carbapenemase-producing <i>K. pneumoniae</i> (18.6%) and <i>E. coli</i> (9.2%), were identified as key resistance mechanisms impacting clinical outcomes. Patients with MDR infections had significantly longer ICU stays (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and higher mortality rates. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that <i>A. baumannii</i> infections were associated with the highest mortality risk (HR: 4.6, <i>p</i> < 0.001), followed by <i>MRSA</i> (HR: 3.5, <i>p</i> = 0.005) and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (HR: 2.8, <i>p</i> = 0.01). Among laboratory biomarkers, elevated procalcitonin (≥2 ng/mL, OR: 2.8, <i>p</i> = 0.008) and CRP (≥100 mg/L, OR: 2.2, <i>p</i> = 0.01) were significantly associated with ICU mortality. Additionally, patients who remained in the ICU for more than seven days had a 1.4-fold increased risk of mortality (<i>p</i> = 0.02), further emphasizing the impact of prolonged hospitalization on adverse outcomes. MDR pathogens, particularly <i>A. baumannii</i>, <i>MRSA</i>, <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, and <i>K. pneumoniae</i>, are associated with longer ICU stays and higher mortality rates. Carbapenem, cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside resistance significantly impact clinical outcomes, emphasizing the urgent need for antimicrobial stewardship programs. ESBL, p-AmpC, and carbapenemase-producing <i>Enterobacterales</i> further worsen patient outcomes, highlighting the need for early infection control strategies and optimized empirical antibiotic selection. Biomarkers such as procalcitonin and CRP, alongside clinical severity scores, serve as valuable prognostic tools for ICU mortality.",

        "abstract": "Over the past 5 years, since publication of the initial review, studies have provided additional data on macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance in Mycoplasma genitalium, including data from regions previously lacking this information. We aimed to provide contemporary estimates of macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance in M genitalium to inform national, regional, and global treatment guidelines. This is an update of a previous systematic review and meta-analysis, which was performed up to Jan 7, 2019. In this update, we searched PubMed, Embase, and MEDLINE from Jan 1, 2018, to April 18, 2023, for published studies reporting macrolide, fluoroquinolone, or dual-class (macrolide and fluoroquinolone) resistance in M genitalium. Data were combined with the previous meta-analysis to examine resistance prevalence in M genitalium samples collected up to and including 2021. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate summary estimates of prevalence. Subgroup analyses by WHO region and four time periods (before 2012 to 2018-21) were performed. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42021273340. 166 studies (59 from the previous search period reporting data from M genitalium samples collected between 2003 and 2017, and 107 from the updated search period reporting data from M genitalium samples collected between 2005 and 2021) were included: 157 reporting macrolide resistance (41 countries; 22 974 samples), 89 reporting fluoroquinolone resistance (35 countries; 14 165 samples), and 74 reporting dual-class resistance (34 countries; 11 070 samples). In 2018-21, the overall prevalence of macrolide, fluoroquinolone, and dual-class resistance were 33·3% (95% CI 27·2-39·7), 13·3% (10·0-17·0), and 6·5% (4·0-9·4), respectively. Over time, there was a slight, although not statistically significant, decline in macrolide resistance in the Western Pacific and the Americas, but there was an increase in macrolide resistance in the European region. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in the Western Pacific and increased in the European non-Nordic region. ParC S83I was the most common variant associated with fluoroquinolone resistance, increasing from 0% (95% CI <0·0001-0·30) before 2012 to 7·3% (4·7-10·3) in 2018-21; p<sub>trend</sub>=0·055.

Antibiotic susceptibility test was determined by Vitek 2 Compact system. Multilocus Sequence typing (MLST), antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes were examined by PCR and Sanger sequencing. The virulence of KP114 was evaluated through string test, macrophage phagocytosis assay, serum resistance assay, and mouse infection model. Whole-genome sequencing was performed for further analysis of genetic information. The presence of the bla<sub>NDM-1</sub> and bla<sub>SHV-12</sub> genes in KP114 confered resistance to multi-antibiotics. The hypervirulence of KP114 was demonstrated through various in vitro experiments and in vivo mouse infection model. KP114 was found to harbor two distinct plasmids: a drug-resistant plasmid (pKP114-NDM), classified as the IncX3 type, which contained various transfer elements including type IV coupling protein (T4CP) and type IV secretion system (T4SS), and a virulence plasmid (pKP114-vir) that exhibited a high sequence similarity with pLVPK. The results of the conjugation experiment showed that resistance and virulence traits were successfully transferred from KP114 to Escherichia coli EC600 and J53. We reported a Carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-hvKP) strain of ST65 K2 serotype carrying the bla<sub>NDM-1</sub> and bla<sub>SHV-12</sub>, which exhibited hypervirulence and drug resistance with potential for transmission.

        "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel with an important role in the airways. Despite the clinical efficacy of present modulators in restoring the activity of defective CFTR, there are patients who show persistent pulmonary infections, mainly due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Recently, we reported an unprecedented property of antimicrobial peptides i.e. Esc peptides, which consists in their ability to act as potentiators of CFTR carrying the most common mutation (the loss of phenylalanine 508) affecting protein folding, trafficking and gating. In this work, by electrophysiology experiments and computational studies, the capability of these peptides and de-novo designed analogs was demonstrated to recover the function of other mutated forms of CFTR which severely affect the channel gating (G551D and G1349D). This is presumably due to direct interaction of the peptides with the nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) of CFTR, followed by a novel local phenomenon consisting in distancing residues located at the cytosolic side of the NBDs interface, thus stabilizing the open conformation of the pore at its cytosolic end. The most promising peptides for the dual antimicrobial and CFTR potentiator activities were also shown to display antipseudomonal activity in conditions mimicking the CF pulmonary ion transport and mucus obstruction, with a higher efficacy than the clinically used colistin. These studies should assist in development of novel drugs for lung pathology in CF, with dual CFTR potentiator and large spectrum antibiotic activities.",

We present a case of a 10-year-old boy who developed a prolonged febrile illness after traveling to a typhoid-endemic region. Initial treatment with ceftriaxone proved ineffective due to the presence of ESBL-producing <i>S. Typhi</i>, necessitating a change to meropenem combined with azithromycin. Despite persistent fever, the patient showed clinical improvement by day five and became afebrile by day 11, and there was improvement of inflammatory markers and resolution of bacteremia, as confirmed by sterile blood cultures on day 12. This case underscores the challenges in managing MDR typhoid fever and highlights the critical need to maintain appropriate antibiotic regimens, even in the context of prolonged febrile responses. Furthermore, it draws attention to the global spread of MDR and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) <i>S.

There is little information on the implementation of ASP in hospitals in Mexico. This study aimed to characterize ASP in a sample of hospitals in Mexico and to identify the facilitators and barriers perceived in their implementation, including the COVID-19 pandemic. A self-assessment electronic survey was adapted from the CDC and WHO ASP's core elements, considering ASP organization, structure, education, guidelines, interventions, surveillance, monitoring, and reporting processes. The survey was addressed to ASP team leaders in a sample of public and private hospitals carrying out regular antimicrobial stewardship activities in Mexico in 2021 and 2022. Fifty hospitals participated: 32 (64%) public and 18 (36%) private. Fifty-two percent of hospitals had an official ASP document, 12% allocated protected time for ASP professionals, and 34% had an annual plan. Most hospitals had an ASP committee (68%); only 14% allocated funding. Most interventions were restrictive (68%); 61% of hospitals prepared cumulative antibiograms periodically, 54% monitored antimicrobial consumption (DDD/DOT), 44% monitored adherence to guidelines, and 24% monitored the implementation of interventions. The main barriers identified were work overload, insufficient human resources, and hospital reconversion due to COVID-19 (particularly in public hospitals), while the support of hospital authorities was the most important facilitator. This diagnosis provides a baseline for strengthening ASP implementation in the country's hospitals.

Miniaturised chromogenic bacterial cultivation including rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (RAST) at the POC can be successfully used for the diagnosis of UTI. Using small and cost-effective dipsticks containing chromogenic cultivation media, UTI-causing bacteria can be detected, quantified and identified with good sensitivity and specificity.

        "abstract": "<i>β</i>-lactam antibiotics are essential medications for treating human diseases. The spread of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> (ESBL-PE) exists globally in multiple reservoirs and the natural environment and poses an immense threat to public health. Plasmid incompatibility groups, such as IncFIA, IncI1, IncY, IncFIB, IncN, IncFIC, IncX4, IncB/O/K/Z, IncHI1/2, and IncA/C, which exist in humans, animals, and the environment, carrying <i>bla</i> <sub>CTX-M</sub>, <i>bla</i> <sub>TEM</sub>, and <i>bla</i> <sub>SHV</sub> genes. The IS<i>Ecp1</i> upstream and orf477 downstream of <i>bla</i> <sub>CTX-M</sub> genes, as well as other mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as IS<i>903</i> and IS<i>26</i>, are involved in capturing and mobilizing antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs). The <i>bla</i> <sub>CTX-M-15</sub> gene is the most common among all discussed reservoirs. The environmental reservoir and propagation mode of ESBL-PE are increasing and difficult to control. The reasons include but are not limited to bacterial adaptability and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mediated by MGEs and plasmids. Conjugation is a pathway of HGT that is almost uncontrollable. MGEs and plasmids such as Tn<i>3</i>, IS<i>1380</i> families, IncI1, IncK, and IncN are facilitating HGT of <i>bla</i> <sub>CTX-M</sub> genes. This review highlights the need to monitor trends in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the natural environment. Therefore, policies such as antibiotic management plans, training for healthcare providers and/or patients, cautious use of antibiotics, the need for epidemiological networks, pre-travel consultations, World Health Organization (WHO) infection control and biosafety guidelines, and other intervention measures are considered desirable.",

        "abstract": "Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy PEP) is increasingly used among men who have sex with men (MSM). Its impact on antimicrobial resistance and the microbiome is uncertain. We used Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) surveillance data from King County, Washington, USA, and joinpoint regression to investigate trends in NG-tetracycline resistance (tetR), 2017-2024 and, among sexual health clinic (SHC) patients, evaluated the association of NG-tetR with doxy PEP use. We evaluated nasopharyngeal colonization with Staphylococcus aureus and Group A Streptococcus (GAS) in 703 MSM SHC patients, August 2023-July 2024. Among 2312 MSM with NG, tetR was stable 2017 to quarter 1 (Q1) 2023 (mean = 27%) and thereafter rose to 70% in Q2 2024 (P < .0001). (King County released doxy PEP guidelines in Q2 2023.) NG with high-level (HL) tetR increased Q1 2021 to Q2 2024 (2% to 65%) (P < .0001). Taking >3 doses of doxy PEP/month was associated with both tetR and HL tetR (P ≤ .01 for both), though any use of doxy PEP was not associated with tetR or HL tetR. S. aureus colonization was less common among doxy PEP users than non-users (27% vs 36%, P = .02), but colonization with both tetracycline-resistant S. aureus and GAS were more common among doxy PEP users than non-users (18% vs 8%, P < .0001% and 9% vs 4%, P = .008, respectively). TetR in NG rapidly increased from 2021 to 2024, and most NG among King County MSM now have HL tetR. Doxy PEP use is associated with colonization with GAS and tetracycline-resistant S. aureus, suggesting that doxy PEP impacts off-target bacteria.",

        "abstract": "Critical illness can affect antimicrobial pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Antimicrobial stewardship programs promote appropriate antimicrobial usage. This study aimed to compare the appropriateness of antibiotic dosing, therapeutic drug monitoring, and ICU mortality before and after antimicrobial stewardship program implementation in medical intensive care units. This retrospective study was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand. Adults admitted to medical intensive care units from August 1, 2019, to July 31, 2021, who received selected antibiotics in the antimicrobial stewardship program were included. During the intervention period, general education as well as prospective audit with intervention and feedback were implemented by infectious disease pharmacist and clinical pharmacists. The appropriateness of dosing, therapeutic drug monitoring, and ICU mortality were compared before and after antimicrobial stewardship program implementation. There were 269 patients (455 prescriptions) and 376 patients (604 prescriptions) in the pre- and post-antimicrobial stewardship program implementation groups, respectively. Meropenem was the commonly prescribed antibiotic in both groups. Overall, the appropriateness of dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring improved after antimicrobial stewardship program implementation (36% to 63.58%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Infectious disease and clinical pharmacists provided 40 interventions with an 87.5% acceptance rate. The most common recommendation was maintenance dose adjustment (79.17% acceptance rate). ICU mortality (29.37% to 18.62%, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and length of hospital stay in the ICU (7 days to 5 days, <i>p</i> = 0.005) were lower in the post-antimicrobial stewardship program implementation group. Pharmacist-led education and prospective audit and feedback on antibiotic dose optimization can improve appropriate antibiotic dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring with a high acceptance rate. We suggest implementing this strategy in other intensive care units such as surgical intensive care units. We still found some nonadherence to our dosing guidelines; additional strategies to optimize dosing should be evaluated.",

We assessed antifungal policies from five countries of varying size, IFI burden, and geography: the Netherlands, Italy, South Korea, China, and India. These countries were selected as a representative sample reflecting different types of economic and health systems that patients and providers access worldwide. This assessment focused on a comprehensive range of antifungal policy elements, including recognition and prioritization, awareness and education, prevention and monitoring, diagnosis and coordinated care, access to appropriate treatment, and diagnostic and treatment innovation. Although countries in this analysis all have some form of policy for IFI management, we have identified substantial gaps, including low prioritization of IFI diagnostics, omission of fungal pathogens from antimicrobial resistance policies, and a general lack of awareness and healthcare professional (HCP) training on IFI management. The gaps identified are intended to inform HCPs and policy- and decision-makers about aspects to consider in reducing the IFI burden for patients and health systems while demonstrating responsible antifungal stewardship.",

        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance represents a significant public health challenge, resulting in an estimated 4.95 million deaths annually. In response to the global escalation of antimicrobial resistance in prevalent hospital-acquired infections such as surgical site infections (SSIs), the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified critical and priority pathogens necessitating research and development. Nevertheless, there remains a paucity of data from numerous developing nations. Therefore this study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of SSIs, examine the microbial profile, and identify factors associated with SSIs, with a particular emphasis on WHO-priority pathogens during the COVID-19 pandemic at a general hospital in southern Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 207 adult patients clinically suspected of SSIs from September 1, 2019, to November 2022. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, and surgery-related variables were collected using pre-tested, structured, interviewer-administered questionnaires and patient chart reviews. Wound samples (swabs and/or pus) were collected aseptically from each participant following standard microbiological procedures and processed for isolation and identification of pathogens by conventional culture and biochemical testing. Bacterial isolates subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, including the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), by the standard Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method in accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Data were analyzed by Statistical Packages for Social Science (SPSS) version 25, and bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was done to determine the associations between dependent and independent variables. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) was reported, and P-value < 5% was considered statistically significant. The overall prevalence of culture-confirmed SSIs among adult patients who underwent major surgery was 76.8% (95% CI: 71.0, 82.6). Among the 178 pathogens recovered, 58.5% were Gram-negative, 40.4% were Gram-positive, and 1.1% were Candida spp. The ESKAPE pathogens comprised 65.3% of the isolates, with S. aureus being the most common species, accounting for 43.5%, followed by K. pneumoniae (33.9%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was observed in 84.37% of ESKAPE pathogens, with ESBL-producing and MRSA-producing isolates accounting for 88% and 76.5%, respectively. A. baumannii showed the highest MDR rate at 100%, followed by MRSA (90%) and K. pneumoniae (88.23%). Amikacin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam were effective agents against Gram-negatives, while linezolid, clindamycin, and gentamicin were most effective against Gram-positive bacteria. SSIs was significantly associated with emergency surgery (P < 0.001), prolonged surgery waiting time (P = 0.004), and clean-contaminated surgery (P = 0.008). The high prevalence of MDR-ESKAPE pathogens is concerning, highlighting the need for improved infection prevention practices and antimicrobial stewardship programs.",

        "abstract": "ODYSSEY showed superior efficacy for dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) versus standard of care (SOC) in children living with HIV starting first-line or second-line ART aged 4 weeks or older. Here, we aim to compare virological outcomes and resistance in the dolutegravir group versus SOC for first-line and second-line ART up to 96 weeks. ODYSSEY was an open-label, multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial done in 29 centres in seven countries (Germany, Spain, South Africa, Thailand, the UK, Uganda, and Zimbabwe). ODYSSEY recruited children living with HIV aged at least 28 days and younger than 18 years, weighing at least 3 kg, starting first-line ART (ODYSSEY A), or switching to second-line therapy after treatment failure (ODYSSEY B). Children were randomly assigned (1:1) to dolutegravir plus two nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs; dolutegravir group) versus the SOC group (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI], boosted protease inhibitor, or non-dolutegravir integrase strand-transfer inhibitor, plus two NRTIs). Two randomised cohorts were combined in this exploratory analysis: children weighing at least 14 kg were enrolled between Sept 20, 2016, and June 22, 2018, and children weighing less than 14 kg were enrolled between July 5, 2018, and Aug 26, 2019. Virological failure was defined as an inadequate virological response at week 24 with an ART switch or confirmed HIV-1 RNA viral load of at least 400 copies per mL after week 36. Virological suppression was defined as two consecutive viral loads of less than 400 copies per mL and was compared between groups, including an ART switch and death as competing risks. Children with virological failure were tested for post-failure genotypic resistance, with baseline results used to identify emergent resistance. Development of emergent resistance was a secondary trial outcome and all other outcomes are exploratory. ODYSSEY was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02259127), EUDRACT (2014-002632-14), and ISRCTN (ISRCTN91737921). In ODYSSEY at enrolment, 381 participants started first-line ART (ODYSSEY A: 189 in the dolutegravir group and 192 in the SOC group) and 407 participants started second-line ART (ODYSSEY B: 202 in the dolutegravir group and 205 in the SOC group). 72 participants in ODYSSEY A and 13 participants in ODYSSEY B weighed less than 14 kg. 401 (51%) of 788 participants were female and 387 (49%) were male. Virological suppression occurred significantly earlier in the dolutegravir group (adjusted [cause-specific] hazard ratio [HR] 1·57 [95% CI 1·35 to 1·83]; p<0·0001). Overall, 51 (13%) participants had virological failure by 96 weeks in the dolutegravir group versus 86 (22%) in the SOC group (including 18 [10%] vs 43 [22%] in ODYSSEY A and in 33 [16%] vs 43 [21%] in ODYSSEY B; adjusted HR 0·56 [0·40 to 0·79]; p=0·0011). Among ODYSSEY B participants starting dolutegravir, virological failure was higher in children starting zidovudine (HR 2·22 [1·01 to 4·88]; p=0·048) and similar in those starting tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (1·19 [0·50 to 2·83]; p=0·70) compared with abacavir. Time to virological suppression was marginally faster in participants receiving second-line dolutegravir and abacavir with high-level abacavir resistance at baseline compared with those with no, low-level, intermediate-level resistance (cause-specific HR 1·70 [1·01 to 2·85]; p=0·046); and failure rates by week 96 were similar (HR 0·90 [0·23 to 3·61]; p=0·88). An estimated 1% (95% CI 0 to 2) of participants in the dolutegravir group versus 20% (14 to 26) in the SOC group in ODYSSEY A had emergent resistance to at least one drug-class within their first-line regimen (risk difference -20% [-25 to -14]; p<0·0001); 4% (1 to 6) versus 5% (2 to 8) had resistance to drug within their initial second-line regimen (risk difference -1% [-5 to 3]; p=0·60). 3% (0 to 5) of participants in the dolutegravir group had emergent integrase strand-transfer inhibitors resistance compared with 3% (1 to 6) of participants in the SOC group who had emergent resistance to the anchor drug (risk difference 0% [-4 to 3]; p=0·78). Dolutegravir led to faster virological suppression and lower risk of virological failure than NNRTIs and boosted protease inhibitor-based SOC. Participants starting second-line dolutegravir-based ART with an abacavir or tenofovir backbone were at lower risk of virological failure than those starting zidovudine. During first-line therapy, dolutegravir protected against emergent resistance; starting second-line therapy, the risk of emergent resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone, and anchor drugs, was similar among participants starting dolutegravir within their second-line regimen and those starting mainly boosted protease inhibitor-based SOC.

This study aims to examine the patterns of antibiotic prescription in primary healthcare settings (PHC) in Sudan and its compliance to the World Health Organization (WHO) Access, Watch and Reserve (AWaRe) antibiotic book. We collected retrospective data on antibiotic prescriptions at 325 PHCs in five states in Sudan for 2022. We collected patient-level data only for prescriptions with at least one antimicrobial prescribed. We used descriptive analysis to identify patterns of antibiotic prescribing according to the WHO AWaRe classification and to calculate the compliance of antibiotic prescriptions against the WHO AWaRe antibiotic book. A total of 52,274 antimicrobials were prescribed during 41,102 outpatient visits. Antibiotics accounted for 84.1% (n = 43,941) of prescriptions, of which 29.0% (n = 15,160) belonged to the Access antibiotics while 71.0% (n = 37,114) were from the Watch group. None of the prescribed antibiotics were from the Reserve group. Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia showed the highest compliance to the WHO AWaRe antibiotic book (40.1%, n = 447) followed by typhoid (31.5%, n = 53) and urinary tract infection (22.2%, n = 486).

Candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis primarily affect patients who are immunocompromised or critically ill. In contrast, mucocutaneous forms of candidiasis, such as oral thrush and vulvovaginal candidiasis, can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. Although mucocutaneous candidiasis is generally not life-threatening, it can cause considerable discomfort, recurrent infections, and complications, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes or in those taking immunosuppressive therapies. The rise of difficult-to-treat Candida infections is driven by new host factors and antifungal resistance. Pathogens, such as Candida auris (Candidozyma auris) and fluconazole-resistant Candida parapsilosis, pose serious global health risks. Recent taxonomic revisions have reclassified several Candida spp, potentially causing confusion in clinical practice.

However, pharmacy education in Japan lacks comprehensive antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) content, leading to insufficient antibiotic awareness and literacy among graduates. This study aimed to assess and improve antibiotic literacy and awareness among undergraduate pharmacy students at Showa University. Students who were admitted in 2015 were given a 90-min lecture on AMS, covering acute upper respiratory infections, before their fifth-year clinical training in 2019. The lecture was delivered by a certified pharmacist in infection control. A paper-based, anonymous self-administered questionnaire survey on antibiotic knowledge and literacy was distributed to first- and fifth-year students in 2019 and fifth-year students in 2023. The questions in the survey were based on the Antibiotics Awareness Survey 2018. The survey results showed an 82-99% response rate among first- and fifth-year pharmacy students in 2019 and 2023. Although two-thirds of first-year pharmacy students lacked antibiotic knowledge, most fifth-year students had appropriate knowledge. Moreover, fifth-year students had a proper understanding of bacterial infections and antibiotic identification, which improved after clinical training and additional lectures. The percentage of students who would stop using antibiotics when they felt better dropped from 39% among first-year students to 21% among fifth-year students. Fifth-year students were more likely to dispose of leftover antibiotics and less likely to keep them than first-year students. Over 80% of students provided antibiotic counseling primarily for common cold treatments during clinical training. The survey results highlighted gaps in antibiotic awareness among Japanese pharmacy students and demonstrated the positive impact of education. This study emphasizes the need for an antibiotic literacy curriculum, especially for viral respiratory infections, to support efforts in curbing AMR. Moreover, policymakers should develop policies for developing and securing faculty that are knowledgeable in clinical infectious diseases across Japanese pharmacy schools.",

        "abstract": "The World Health Organization global antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (GLASS) was rolled out in 2015 to guide antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance. However, its implementation in Africa has not been fully evaluated. We conducted a scoping review to establish the progress of implementing the WHO 2015 GLASS manual in Africa. We used MeSH terms to comprehensively search electronic databases (MEDLINE and Embase) for articles from Africa published in English between January 2016 and December 2023. The Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework for scoping reviews was employed. Data were collected on compliance with WHO GLASS recommendations for AMR surveillance-priority samples, pathogens, and pathogen-antibiotic combinations and analysed using Microsoft Excel. Overall, 13,185 articles were identified. 7,409 were duplicates, and 5,141 articles were excluded based on titles and abstracts. 609 full-text articles were reviewed, and 147 were selected for data extraction. Of the 147 selected articles, 78.9% had been published between 2020 and 2023; 57.8% were from Eastern Africa. 93.9% of articles were on cross-sectional studies. 96.6% included only one priority sample type; blood (n=56), urine (n=64), and stool (n=22). Of the 60 articles that focused on blood as a priority sample type, 71.7%, 68.3%, 68.3%, 36.7%, 30%, and 10% reported recovery of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, <i>Salmonella</i> species and <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae,</i> respectively. <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>Shigella</i> species were reported to have been recovered from 91.3% and 73.9% of the 23 articles that focused on stool. <i>E. coli</i> and <i>K. pneumoniae</i> recoveries were also reported from 94.2% and 68.1% of the 69 articles that focused on urine. No article in this review reported having tested all the recommended WHO GLASS pathogen-antibiotic combinations for specific pathogens. Progress has been made in implementing the GLASS recommendations in Africa, but adoption varies across countries limiting standardisation and comparability of data.",

        "title": "Surgical prophylaxis in Haydom Lutheran Hospital, Tanzania - learning from a point prevalence survey.",
        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant global health concern, with improper antibiotic use contributing to its rise. Tanzania initiated an AMR action plan in 2017, but comprehensive surveillance and stewardship efforts remain limited. This study focused on evaluating antibiotic use, particularly surgical prophylaxis, in a rural Tanzanian hospital. The study was conducted at Haydom Lutheran Hospital in Tanzania in May 2023, using a cross-sectional point prevalence survey. Antibiotic use in all patients admitted for >24 h and those undergoing surgery was recorded, including type, dose, indication and duration. Quality indicators for surgical prophylaxis were assessed. Among 199 inpatients, 55% received antibiotics, with surgical prophylaxis accounting for 23% of prescriptions. Notably, none of the patients who received surgical prophylaxis received a single-dose regimen, and 67% exceeded the recommended 24-h duration. A combination of ampicillin-cloxacillin plus metronidazole was the most commonly prescribed combination for surgical prophylaxis (41% of prescriptions). Thirty-three percent of the antibiotics prescribed for surgical prophylaxis were classified as 'Not recommended' by the World Health Organization. Furthermore, 90% of surgical prophylaxis prescriptions lacked documented rationale, and 83% of prescriptions lacked stop/review dates in medical records. This study reveals a high prevalence of prolonged antibiotic use for surgical prophylaxis, frequent use of antibiotics classified as 'Not recommended', and a lack of adequate documentation, which deviates from international standards. These practices highlight the urgent need for contextualized national guidelines, large-scale implementation projects of evidence-based interventions, and local initiatives in antibiotic stewardship, particularly in low-resource settings.",

        "title": "Antibiotic prophylaxis for surgical-site infections and adherence to evidence-based guidelines.",
        "abstract": "Antimicrobial prophylaxis is an established practice for reducing surgical-site infections; however, its misuse promotes alternative challenges including antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study was to determine factors associated with adherence to surgical antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines. Adults aged 18 and older who underwent 1 of 5 selected procedures between 2004 and 2022 were included. The proportion of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis was determined for each procedure type. A logistic regression model was built to identify factors impacting appropriate prophylaxis practices. Among our cohort of 9,543 patients, 4,883 were women (51.2%); mean age was 60.1 years. Most patients were White (8,407; 88.1%). Cardiothoracic, neurosurgical, gastrointestinal, and plastic surgery procedures were individually associated with decreased odds of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis use compared with orthopedic procedures (P < .05). Patients undergoing a cardiothoracic procedure were less likely to receive the correct antibiotic (59.0%). Patients undergoing a gastrointestinal procedure were less likely to receive prophylaxis with the appropriate start time (72.6%) or duration (5.4%). Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis was more likely in patients who were male (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.18) and White (odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.22). Appropriate prophylaxis was significantly greater in procedures after 2010 (representing the establishment of an antimicrobial stewardship program) compared with procedures before 2010 (odds ratio, 2.05; confidence interval, 1.95-2.16). Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis practices demonstrated significant variation according to specialty type, patient characteristics, and the implementation of an antimicrobial stewardship program. These findings suggest the beneficial role of stewardship programs and gaps where interventions can be targeted, particularly antibiotic selection and discontinuation timing.",

        "title": "Can infectious omphalitis in piglets be clinically diagnosed during the first three days of life?",
        "abstract": "Globally, the increase in antimicrobial resistance is of great concern. In Denmark, the pig sector is accountable for the majority of antimicrobial usage in animals. As new-born piglets are at risk of developing infectious omphalitis, and many pigs are treated by antimicrobials within the first days of life, an early and accurate diagnosis of the disease is imperative to maintain animal welfare and reduce the antimicrobial usage. The aim of the present study was to compare histopathological and microbiological findings in piglets clinically diagnosed with and without omphalitis during the first three days after birth. A total of 98 case piglets with omphalitis and 98 control piglets without omphalitis, based on clinical examinations during the first three days of life, were included. Of the 196 piglets, 79 (38 cases and 41 controls) presented histopathological omphalitis. Post mortem, the volume of the umbilicus was significantly enlarged in cases compared to controls (p = 0.01). Except for a group of bacteria unidentified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) (p = 0.02), no apparent association was found between histopathologically diagnosed omphalitis and the prevalence of specific pathogens (p > 0.05). The frequency of histopathologically diagnosed omphalitis tended to increase with increasing age in both cases and controls. The frequency of piglets with both histopathological omphalitis and arthritis/synovitis was significantly different among cases and controls (p = 0.05). This was due to all controls, and none of the cases, with arthritis/synovitis presented histopathological omphalitis. The clinical differentiation between omphalitis cases and controls did not correspond to the histological diagnosis of omphalitis in zero-to-three days old piglets. An inaccurate clinical diagnosis complicates prudent use of antimicrobials in pig herds. In addition, animal welfare may be hampered in infected piglets due to lack of treatment and in healthy piglets due to the antimicrobial effect on the gut microbiome.",

        "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of children's pulmonary infections. However, there are fewer studies on RSV infections in adults. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations, para-clinical characteristics, and outcome of RSV infection among adult patients who were referred to the Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex during the winter and spring of 2022-2023. From December 21, 2022, to May 20, 2023, we conducted a cross-sectional study on hospitalized adults having positive RT-PCR results for RSV. We further assessed the clinical and para-clinical characteristics and outcomes of the RSV groups. We screened 1375 adults with suspected acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and confirmed RSV infections in 59 of them (4.3%). Of these, 23 patients were excluded from further analysis due to outpatient management, leaving 36 hospitalized patients with confirmed RSV infection (61.01%). The mean age of the hospitalized patients was 53.28 ± 20.37 years (range: 15-83), with a slightly higher proportion of females (52.80%) compared to males (47.20%). Dyspnea, productive cough, and fever were the most common symptoms, with a mean symptom duration of 10.50 days. Ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and liver failure were common underlying conditions. Notably, biochemical and inflammatory markers such as CRP, ESR, and LDH were significantly elevated beyond the normal range. Finally, five patients (13.9%) who received intensive care treatments died. Although the rate of RSV infection was not high among Iranian adults, a greater proportion of patients required hospitalization (61%). There was a significant link between liver failure, an elevated INR, more than 30% bilateral pulmonary involvement, abdominal pain, longer ICU stays, and immunodeficiency cases with increased mortality from RSV infection. We suggest that RSV infection may act as a secondary factor in decompensating pre-existing liver failure, which was present in certain patients with underlying conditions, potentially leading to life-threatening consequences.",

        "title": "[Chinese expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease complicated with bronchiectasis].",
        "abstract": "The incidence and prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) and bronchiectasis have been both increasing. NTM-PD can lead to bronchiectasis, and <i>vice versa</i>, with each condition mutually exacerbating the other. Macrolides play a pivotal role in NTM-PD treatment. Additionally, long-term, low-dose oral macrolides are preferred to prevent recurrent acute exacerbations in bronchiectasis patients. However, using macrolides alone may risk inducing non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) resistance in bronchiectasis patients potentially infected with NTM. The European Respiratory Society (ERS) and British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines advocate for NTM screening among bronchiectasis patients before receiving long-term, low-dose oral macrolide therapy. Consequently, the focus in clinical practice has shifted towards diagnosing and managing the coexistence of NTM-PD and bronchiectasis. Recognizing these developments, Chinese respiratory experts have established the \"<i>Expert consensus on diagnosis and treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis</i>.\"In this expert consensus，systematic reviews were conducted for each of the 10 Population，Intervention，Comparator，Outcome（PICO）questions. Recommendations were formulated，written，and graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment，Development，and Evaluation（GRADE）approach. Fourteen evidence-based recommendations regarding the diagnosis and treatment of NTM-PD in conjunction with bronchiectasis are presented. In the future，it is hoped that this consensus will enhance the diagnosis and treatment of NTM-PD and bronchiectasis comorbidity in China.<b>Question 1</b>：Is etiological testing necessary when bronchiectasis is diagnosed in NTM-PD patients？<b>Recommendation 1</b>：Bronchiectasis of different etiologies requires distinct treatment strategies and prognoses. Therefore，when NTM-PD patients are diagnosed with bronchiectasis，it is recommended its etiology be investigated. This investigation will aid in the diagnosis，treatment，and prognosis of patients with this comorbidity（1C）.<b>Recommendation 2</b>：Methods to investigate and evaluate the etiology of bronchiectasis include：（1）obtaining medical history and clinical symptoms；（2）performing a sputum culture，complete blood count，serum immunoglobulin levels（IgG，IgM，IgA），Aspergillus-specific IgE，and serum total IgE levels，and pulmonary function tests；（3）If genetic or autoimmune diseases are suspected，performing additional relevant specialized tests.<b>Question 2</b>：What are the clinical characteristics of bronchiectasis patients who should be screened for NTM infection？What tests and samples are recommended？<b>Recommendation 3</b>：Bronchiectasis patients meeting the following criteria should be evaluated for possible NTM infection：（1）newly diagnosed bronchiectasis patients；（2）those with unexplained clinical or radiographic exacerbations of bronchiectasis；（3）patients with bronchiectasis planning long-term macrolide therapy（1B）.<b>Recommendation 4</b>：Recommended specimens for examination include：（1）sputum，induced sputum，bronchial secretions（or lavage fluid），and other respiratory specimens；（2）pathological specimens from lung and mediastinal lymph nodes obtained via puncture and biopsy. Recommended tests encompass acid-fast staining smear and mycobacterial culture（solid or liquid medium）（1a）. Molecular tests such as high-throughput sequencing and mass spectrometry offer high diagnostic efficiency and strain-level identification，conditionally recommended to assist in diagnosis as per the relevant expert consensus（2D）.<b>Question 3</b>：Should patients with bronchiectasis be screened for NTM-PD before initiating long-term macrolide therapy？<b>Recommendation 5</b>：Prior to initiating long-term macrolide therapy for bronchiectasis，particularly in patients with a history of NTM-PD，it is crucial to ascertain the presence of active NTM-PD or past MAC-PD. If such conditions are identified，the long-term use of low-dose macrolides alone for bronchiectasis treatment is not recommended（2C）.<b>Question 4</b>：Should anti-NTM therapy be initiated immediately when a patient with bronchiectasis is also diagnosed with NTM-PD？<b>Recommendation 6</b>：In patients with NTM-PD and bronchiectasis comorbidity，initiation of anti-NTM therapy is recommended when there are positive sputum acid-fast staining smears and/or radiographic evidence of cavitary lesions（2B）.<b>Question 5</b>：How should anti-infective drugs be chosen if bronchiectasis infection worsens during anti-NTM treatment in patients with NTM-PD and bronchiectasis？<b>Recommendation 7</b>：Prior to initiating antibiotic therapy，perform a comprehensive etiological testing of sputum and/or respiratory secretions，including bacterial and fungal cultures and drug sensitivity testing（1A）. Empirical antimicrobial therapy should be started before etiological results are available. Antibiotic selection should be guided by prior drug sensitivity testing. For patients with moderate to severe bronchiectasis without prior etiological culture results，routine coverage for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> during treatment is recommended（1B）. Apart from bacteria，other pathogens such as viruses and fungi may also contribute to acute exacerbations of the disease，necessitating differential diagnosis（2C）.<b>Question 6</b>：How should patients with NTM-PD and bronchiectasis，who have failed anti-NTM treatment or who cannot tolerate regular anti-NTM therapy，be treated？<b>Recommendation 8</b>：For patients who have failed anti-NTM therapy or are unable to tolerate standard anti-NTM regimens，it is recommended to focus on the treatment and management of bronchiectasis（2C）.<b>Question 7</b>：What are the recommendations for the use of glucocorticoids in patients with NTM-PD and bronchiectasis comorbidity who require glucocorticoid treatment for other conditions？<b>Recommendation 9</b>：Regular use of glucocorticoids for symptom control in patients with NTM-PD and bronchiectasis comorbidity is not recommended. Inhaled bronchodilators are recommended for patients with obstructive ventilation dysfunction. In cases where conditions such as asthma，systemic lupus erythematosus，rheumatoid arthritis，or other diseases necessitate glucocorticoid use for disease control，caution should be exercised based on the diagnosis and treatment guidelines of the respective diseases or consensus（2C）.<b>Question 8</b>：What are the recommendations for surgical treatment in patients with NTM-PD and bronchiectasis comorbidity？<b>Recommendation 10</b>：Surgical treatment should be approached with caution，and surgery is not recommended if anti-mycobacterial treatment is effective（1A）. Lung resection surgery for NTM pulmonary disease should only be considered after expert multidisciplinary assessment in a center experienced in managing NTM-pulmonary disease（1B）.<b>Recommendation 11</b>：Patients with concentrated and limited lung lesions，acceptable cardiopulmonary function without contraindications，and who meet one of the following conditions may be candidates for surgery：（1）multiple drug susceptibility tests showing macrolide-resistant NTM strains and regular antimycobacterial therapy failure；or patients infected with macrolide-resistant <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> who have not responded adequately to medical treatment；（2）patients experiencing refractory hemoptysis，which poses a potential life-threatening risk，despite improvement in other symptoms following drug treatment；（3）repeated NTM infections that significantly impact patients' daily life and work（1B）.<b>Recommendation 12</b>：Following thoracic surgery in patients with NTM-PD complicated by bronchiectasis，it is recommended that anti-NTM treatment be continued post-operatively for a minimum of 12 months until sputum culture conversion is achieved（1B）.<b>Question 9</b>：How should the therapeutic effect and outcome of NTM-PD and bronchiectasis comorbidity be evaluated？<b>Recommendation 13：</b> When evaluating treatment effect and outcomes in patients with NTM-PD and bronchiectasis comorbidity，both the \"prognostic criteria of NTM-PD\" and \"symptom indicators of bronchiectasis\" should be considered（1B）. Treatment outcomes can be categorized into three grades：（1）cure stage：meeting any of the criteria ①-④ for NTM-PD and in a stable period of bronchiectasis；（2）improvement stage：meeting any of the criteria ①-④ for NTM-PD，or in a stable period of bronchiectasis；（3）treatment failure：meeting any of the criteria ⑤-⑦ for NTM-PD，and experiencing repeated acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis（2D）；（3）for patients with immune dysfunction or long-term use of immunosuppressants/hormones，the dosage or duration of immunosuppressants/hormones are supposed to be reduced as much as possible without affecting the efficacy of the original disease under the guidance and supervision of the professional doctors. Meanwhile，it is recommended to regularly recheck chest CT and sputum mycobacterial culture.<b>Question 10</b>：How should recurrence be managed and prevented in patients with NTM-PD and bronchiectasis after bacteriological negative conversion or cure？<b>Recommendation 14</b>：It is recommended to modify lifestyle and habits to reduce environmental exposure to NTM（1B）. For patients with a low body mass index and/or a history of weight loss，nutritional assessment and intervention should be considered（2D）.",
