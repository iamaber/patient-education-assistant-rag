        "indications": "3-Geocef is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms. Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI) : e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis. Urinary Tract Infections : e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3-Geocef is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
        "pharmacology": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years : The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly : Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children : The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid : the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years : Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months : The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months. Dosage in Renal Impairment : Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
        "contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
        "side_effects": "3-Geocef is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3-Geocef are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "3-Geocef should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3-Geocef, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3-Geocef should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3-Geocef should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
        "overdose_effects": "Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. 3-Geocef is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of 3-Geocef did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses."

Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3-Geocef should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
        "overdose_effects": "Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. 3-Geocef is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of 3-Geocef did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses."

        "pharmacology": "This preparation is a mixture of antitussive, decongestant and antihistamine agent. Dextromethorphan is a safe, effective, non-narcotic antitussive agent which has a central action on the cough centre in the medulla. Although structurally related to Morphine, it has no analgesic and habit forming properties and in general it has little sedative activity. Phenylephrine is a decongestant that shrinks blood vessels in the nasal passage. Phenylephrine is used for the temporary relief of stuffy nose, sinus, and ear symptoms caused by the common cold, flu, allergies, sinusitis & bronchitis. This medication works by decreasing swelling in the nose and ears, thereby lessening discomfort and making it easier to breathe. Triprolidine is an antihistamine used to relieve symptoms of allergy, hay fever, and the common cold. These symptoms include rash, watery eyes, itchy eyes/nose/throat/skin, cough, runny nose, and sneezing. It is a potent competitive histamine H1-receptor antagonist of the pyrrolidine class with mild central nervous system depressant properties which may cause drowsiness. By antagonizing another natural substance acetylcholine, it helps dry up some body fluids to relieve symptoms such as watery eyes and runny nose.",

It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms. Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI) : e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis. Urinary Tract Infections : e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3RD Cef is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
        "pharmacology": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years : The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly : Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children : The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid : the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years : Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months : The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months. Dosage in Renal Impairment : Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded.

Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported.

If an allergic effect occurs with 3RD Cef, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3RD Cef should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3RD Cef should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",

        "indications": "3-C is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms. Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI) : e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis. Urinary Tract Infections : e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. 3-C is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
        "pharmacology": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years : The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly : Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children : The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid : the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years : Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months : The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months. Dosage in Renal Impairment : Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
        "contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
        "side_effects": "3-C is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with 3-C are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "3-C should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with 3-C, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. 3-C should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 3-C should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
        "overdose_effects": "Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. 3-C is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of 3-C did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses."

The drug works by inhibiting the enzyme thymidylate kinase which results in reduced formation of thymidine and thus of DNA. The active metabolite FdUMP appears to form a stable complex with the folate cofactor N-5, 10-methylene tetrahydrofolate which inactivates thymidylate kinase. Fluorouracil as FdUMP is also incorporated into RNA which results in fluorination of RNA. The effect of fluorouracil on living cells is limited mainly to those in the proliferative phase but while cells in the G2 and S phase are most affected there may be effects at any stage of the cell cycle.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Intravenous 5-fluorouracil can be delivered by rapid intravenous bolus injection or slow infusion. The vial contents can rapidly be injected directly into a peripheral vein, the commonest schedules being: 12-13.5 mg/Kg (500 mg/m2) daily for 5 days repeated at 4-weekly intervals. Slow intravenous infusion requires the drug, to be diluted in 500 ml of dextrose 5% solution, then infused over 2-3 hr on 5 successive days. For palliative management of cancer : Initial Dose: 12 mg/kg intravenously once daily for 4 successive days. Maximum Dose: 800 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 6 mg/kg may be administered on the 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th day (No therapy is given on days 5, 7, 9, or 11). Discontinue at the end of day 12, even with no apparent toxicity. Poor risk patients and those who are not in an adequate nutritional state : Initial Dose: 6 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Maximum Dose: 400 mg/day. If no toxicity is observed, 3 mg/kg may be administered on days 5, 7, and 9 (No therapy is to be administered on days 4, 6, or 8). Discontinue at the end of day 9, even with no apparent toxicity. Maintenance therapy : In instances where toxicity has not been a problem, it is recommended that therapy be continued using either of the following schedules: Repeat the dosage of the first course every 30 days after the last day of the previous course, or When the toxic signs resulting from the initial course of therapy have subsided, administer a maintenance dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg/week as a single dose. Maximum Dose: 1g/week .The reaction by the patient to the previous course of therapy should be taken into account and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly. Usual adult dose for cervical cancer : In combination with cisplatin 1 gm/m2 IV on day 1. The cycle is repeated every 21 days. Usual pediatric dose for malignant disease : The manufacturer has reported that the safety and effectiveness of fluorouracil have not been established in children. However, the drug has been used in children following adult guidelines. Intra-arterial infusion : Fluorouracil has also been given by intra-arterial infusion for adult in doses of 5 to 7.5 mg/kg body weight is dissolved in 20-100 ml of 5% Dextrose solution and administered 10-20 days by using an infusion pump. Combination with radiation : Usual adult daily dose of 5-10 mg/kg body weight is given in combination with radiation according to systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method. Combination with other anticancer drugs : Fluorouracil is used alone or in combination in the adjuvant treatment of breast and gastro-intestinal cancer, and palliation of inoperable malignant neoplasms, especially those of the gastro-intestinal tract, breast, head and neck, liver, genito-urinary system, and pancreas. It is also used with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in the combination chemotherapy of breast cancer. A usual adult dose of 5 to 10 mg/kg body weight daily is given in combination with other anticancer drugs every day or intermittently once to twice a week by systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.",

At the recommended dose and schedule it is rather uncommon for hematological toxicity to be severe. Any ontribute to severe effects from 5-5-Fluril on the blood-forming cells. Thus extensive prior irradiation or the concomitant use of cytotoxic drugs tend to exacerbate the severity of the hematological side effects of 5-5-Fluril. Neurological effects : Effects on the central nervous system have been occasionally reported and cerebral ataxia is dose-dependent with an incidence of between 3.1 and 7%. Acute cerebellar syndromes and myelopathy have been described following intrathecal 5-5-Fluril. Neurological syndromes may occur rarely after carotid artery perfusion in head and neck cancer. Other effects Allergic reaction (including difficulty in breathing, closing of the throat, swelling of the lips, tongue, or face, or hives), decreased bone marrow function and blood problems (extreme fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding, black, bloody or tarry stools, or fever, chills, or signs of infection), hand-foot syndrome (tingling, pain, redness, swelling or tenderness of the hands and feet), severe vomiting, diarrhoea, frequent bowel movements or watery stools, or sores in the mouth or throat, or stomach pain or heartburn or black, bloody or tarry stools. Other less serious side effects may include mild to moderate nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite, balance problems, confusion, rash and itching, or temporary hair loss. Conjunctivitis, both acute and chronic can proceed to tear duct stenosis and ectropion following prolonged administration. Very chronic administration, extending beyond 3 months, of low dosage has been associated with low systemic toxicity but includes the possibility of painful and tender hands and feet associated with erythema of the extremities.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Fluorouracil is contraindicated throughout pregnancy. The literature pertaining to pregnancy and cytotoxic drugs is necessarily limited but it appears in general that risk of teratogenesis diminishes with the advancement of pregnancy. Therefore most cytotoxic drugs are absolutely contraindicated in the first trimester and 5-fluorouracil, used in the first trimester has been reported to cause multiple congenital abnormalities. There are many case reports, however, of pregnancy being conducted successfully with combination chemotherapy being given to the mother during the second and third trimesters. Because of the age of the population and the natural history of the tumors treated, most of the data on long-term follow-up pertain to therapy for leukemias. More data need to be accrued on the subsequent development of neonates before it is certain that any of these compounds are free of late effects. It is not known whether fluorouracil is excreted in human milk. Because fluorouracil inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, mothers should not nurse while receiving this drug.",

Other effects Allergic reaction (including difficulty in breathing, closing of the throat, swelling of the lips, tongue, or face, or hives), decreased bone marrow function and blood problems (extreme fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding, black, bloody or tarry stools, or fever, chills, or signs of infection), hand-foot syndrome (tingling, pain, redness, swelling or tenderness of the hands and feet), severe vomiting, diarrhoea, frequent bowel movements or watery stools, or sores in the mouth or throat, or stomach pain or heartburn or black, bloody or tarry stools. Other less serious side effects may include mild to moderate nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite, balance problems, confusion, rash and itching, or temporary hair loss. Conjunctivitis, both acute and chronic can proceed to tear duct stenosis and ectropion following prolonged administration. Very chronic administration, extending beyond 3 months, of low dosage has been associated with low systemic toxicity but includes the possibility of painful and tender hands and feet associated with erythema of the extremities.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Fluorouracil is contraindicated throughout pregnancy. The literature pertaining to pregnancy and cytotoxic drugs is necessarily limited but it appears in general that risk of teratogenesis diminishes with the advancement of pregnancy. Therefore most cytotoxic drugs are absolutely contraindicated in the first trimester and 5-fluorouracil, used in the first trimester has been reported to cause multiple congenital abnormalities. There are many case reports, however, of pregnancy being conducted successfully with combination chemotherapy being given to the mother during the second and third trimesters. Because of the age of the population and the natural history of the tumors treated, most of the data on long-term follow-up pertain to therapy for leukemias. More data need to be accrued on the subsequent development of neonates before it is certain that any of these compounds are free of late effects. It is not known whether fluorouracil is excreted in human milk. Because fluorouracil inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, mothers should not nurse while receiving this drug.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "5-5 FU PhaRes is highly toxic drug with a narrow margin of safety. Therefore patients should be carefully supervised, since therapeutic response is unlikely to occur without some evidence of toxicity. Daily dose should not exceed 1 gram. Treatment should be discontinued promptly when one of the following signs of toxicity appears: Leucopenia (WBC under 3500/mm3). Thrombocytopenia (platelet under 100000/mm3). Stomatitis ( the first small ulceration at the inner margin of the lips is a signal for stopping treatment). Severe diarrhoea (frequent bowel movements and watery stools). Gastro-intestinal ulceration and bleeding.",
        "overdose_effects": "Cases of deliberate overdose are unknown but excessive toxicity because of the hematological effects as described above. There is no specific antidote to 5-5 FU PhaRes toxicity; treatment consists in supportive care. In addition to the hematological toxicity other toxicities will occur with overdose. Sign and symptoms are qualitatively similar to the side effects. Treatment should be performed promptly and appropriate drugs are given to control symptoms of overdose."

        "pharmacology": "Isosorbide mononitrate is the major active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), and most of the clinical activity of the dinitrate is attributable to the mononitrate. The principal pharmacological action of isosorbide mononitrate is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction and coronary dilatation remains undefined.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Tablet : The usual oral dose is 1 tablet (20 mg) 2 times daily, first dose in the morning and another 7 hours apart. Although maintenance doses ranging from 20 mg to 120 mg (1-6 tablets), a dose of 10 mg (1/2 tablet) is suitable when lower dosage is used at the starting of treatment or as directed by a registered physician. Sustained Release Capsule : The usual oral dose is 1 capsule (50 mg) daily or as directed by the registered physician.",
        "contraindications": "Isosorbide mononitrate is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it. Do not use Isosorbide Mononitrate in patients who are taking certain drugs for erectile dysfunction (phosphodiesterase inhibitors), such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil. Concomitant use can cause severe hypotension, syncope, or myocardial ischemia. Do not use Isosorbide Mononitrate in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension.",
        "side_effects": "Headache, feelings of dizziness, hypotension may occur sometimes.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Pregnancy Category B: Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at doses of up to 540 and 810 mg/kg/day, respectively, have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to isosorbide mononitrate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Isosorbide Mononitrate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether isosorbide mononitrate is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when isosorbide mononitrate is administered to a nursing woman.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with even small doses of A-Card. A-Card should therefore be used with caution in patients who may be volume depleted or who, for whatever reason, are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by A-Card may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In industrial workers who have had long-term exposure to unknown (presumably high) doses of organic nitrates, tolerance clearly occurs. Chest pain, acute myocardial infarction, and even sudden death have occurred during temporary withdrawal of nitrates from these workers, demonstrating the existence of true physical dependence. The importance of these observations to the routine, clinical use of oral A-Card is not known. Patients should be told that the antianginal efficacy of A-Card tablets can be maintained by carefully following the prescribed schedule of dosing (two doses taken seven hours apart). For most patients, this can be accomplished by taking the first dose on awakening and the second dose 7 hours later. As with other nitrates, daily headaches sometimes accompany treatment with A-Card. In patients who get these headaches, the headaches are a marker of the activity of the drug. Patients should resist the temptation to avoid headaches by altering the schedule of their treatment with A-Card, since loss of headache may be associated with simultaneous loss of antianginal efficacy. Aspirin and/or acetaminophen, on the other hand, often successfully relieve A-Card-induced headaches with no deleterious effect on A-Card’s antianginal efficacy. Treatment with A-Card may be associated with light-headedness on standing, especially just after rising from a recumbent or seated position. This effect may be more frequent in patients who have also consumed alcohol.",
        "overdose_effects": "Symptoms : Most common symptoms are hypotension, throbbing headache, tachycardia, and flushing. Methemoglobinemia may occur with massive doses. Treatment : Treatment consists of placing patients in recumbent position and administering fluids; alpha-adrenergic vasopressors may be required. Methemoglobinemia should be treated with methyline blue at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg IV slowly."

Read more Antioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows: β carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with β carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",
        "pharmacology": "Beta carotene of this tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity. Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption. vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.",

Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids. Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation. Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.",

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Patients should be advised not to take other A-One-containing products concurrently. A-One should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary. Administration of A-One in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of A-One. Use caution when administering A-One in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min).

Do not use A-One IV in patients with A-One allergy.",
        "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of A-One. Ingestion of 5 g or more of A-One may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms : Symptoms of A-One overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of A-One overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma A-One concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of A-One. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species, the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone and the Menstrual Regulation (MR) results. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins. Misoprostol: Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1. It causes myometrial contraction by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction. By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents.",

Day 1 (First visit) : Mifepristone administration: One tablet of Mifepristone (200 mg) is taken in a single oral dose under the supervision of a qualified medical professional in a clinic, medical office or hospital. Day 2 (Second visit) : Misoprostol administration: 24-48 hours after ingesting the Mifepristone tablet, the patient takes four 200 microgram tablets (800 micrograms) of Misoprostol buccally or sublingually. Misoprostol tablets can be administered by the patient herself (place two tablets on each side of cheeck & gum or under the tongue). She should wait for 30 minutes. During the period immediately following the administration of Misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient should be given instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive bleeding or other adverse reactions occur and should be given a phone number to call if she has questions following the administration of Misoprostol. Day 10 to 14 (Third visit) : Post-treatment examination: Patients must return to the clinic, medical office or hospital within 10 to 14 days after the administration of mifepristone. This visit is very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at this visit have a risk of fetal malformation resulting from the treatment.

Many hormones with a similar chemical structure, however, are excreted in breast milk. Since the effects of Mifepristone on infants are unknown, breast-feeding women should consult with their doctor to decide if they should discard their breast milk for a few days following administration of the medications. Misoprostol : Although it is not known whether Misoprostol or Misoprostol is excreted through human milk, Misoprostol should not be administered to nursing mothers because the potential excretion of misoprostol acid could cause diarrhoea in nursing infants.",

If a patient ingests a massive overdose, she should be observed closely for signs of adrenal failure. Misoprostol: Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are a sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, palpitations, hypotension or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. However, because Misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be the appropriate treatment for overdosage."

These reactions are probably due to allergic and inflammatory responses to the death of microfilariae. Patients treated with A-Mectin for onchocerciasis may experience these reactions in addition to clinical adverse reactions possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug itself. The treatment of severe Mazzotti reactions has not been subjected to controlled clinical trials. Oral hydration, recumbency, intravenous normal saline, and/or parenteral corticosteroids have been used to treat postural hypotension. Antihistamines and/or aspirin have been used for most mild to moderate cases. After treatment with microfilaricidal drugs, patients with hyperreactive onchodermatitis (sowda) may be more likely than others to experience severe adverse reactions, especially edema and aggravation of onchodermatitis. Rarely, patients with onchocerciasis who are also heavily infected with Loa loa may develop a serious or even fatal encephalopathy either spontaneously or following treatment with an effective microfilaricide. In these patients, the following adverse experiences have also been reported: back pain, conjunctival hemorrhage, dyspnea, urinary and/or fecal incontinence, difficulty in standing/walking, mental status changes, confusion, lethargy, stupor, or coma.",

Retinal and retinol are in chemical equilibrium in the body and have equivalent antixerophthalmic activity. Retinal combines with the rod pigment, opsin, in the retina to form rhodopsin, necessary for visual dark adaptation. Vitamin A prevents retardation of growth and preserves the epithe-lial cells' integrity. Normal adult liver storage is sufficient to satisfy two years'requirements of vitamin A. Vitamin A is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, where the biosynthesis of vitamin A from beta-carotene takes place. Vitamin A absorption requires bile salts, pancreatic lipase, and dietary fat. It is transported in the blood to the liver by the chy lomicron fraction of the lymph. Vitamin Ais stored in Kupffer cells of the liver mainly as the palmitate. Normal serum vitamin A is 80-300 Units per 100 mL (plasma range is 30-70 mcg per dl) and for carotenoids 270-753 Units per 100 mL.The normal adult liver contains approximately 100 to 300 micrograms per gram, mostly as retinol palmitate.",

Absorption : Erythromycin base is destroyed by acid and is therefore administered in the form of stable ester. The rates of absorption of the base and esters are diminished by the presence of food. The stearate is hydrolyzed in the intestine and the free erythromycin absorbed. Blood concentration : After an oral dose of 500 mg. of the base of stearate, peak serum concentrations of 0.9 to 1.4 or 0.4 to 1.8 mg/ml. respectively are attained in 1 to 4 hours. Half-life: The serum half-life is 1.2 to 4 hours. In subjects with oliguria, the half-life is about 5 hours. Distribution : Erythromycin is widely distributed throughout body tissue and fluids with some retention in the liver and spleen, protein binding of erythromycin base is 73%. Erythromycin enters the cerebrospinal fluid when the meninges are inflamed. It also crosses the placenta and is excreted in the milk.

Absorption : Erythromycin base is destroyed by acid and is therefore administered in the form of stable ester. The rates of absorption of the base and esters are diminished by the presence of food. The stearate is hydrolyzed in the intestine and the free erythromycin absorbed. Blood concentration : After an oral dose of 500 mg. of the base of stearate, peak serum concentrations of 0.9 to 1.4 or 0.4 to 1.8 mg/ml. respectively are attained in 1 to 4 hours. Half-life: The serum half-life is 1.2 to 4 hours. In subjects with oliguria, the half-life is about 5 hours. Distribution : Erythromycin is widely distributed throughout body tissue and fluids with some retention in the liver and spleen, protein binding of erythromycin base is 73%. Erythromycin enters the cerebrospinal fluid when the meninges are inflamed. It also crosses the placenta and is excreted in the milk. Excretion : 5 to 15 % of the dose of erythromycin is excreted in the urine and large amounts of the unchanged active substance are excreted in the bile.",

        "pharmacology": "Flucloxacillin is active against Gram-positive organisms including penicillinase producing strains. It has little activity against Gram-negative bacilli. Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures. Flucloxacillin resists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably because of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side chain which prevents the opening of the β- lactam ring.",

        "pharmacology": "Pharmacodynamics : Miconazole possesses an antifungal activity against the common dermatophytes and yeasts as well as an antibacterial activity against certain gram-positive bacilli and cocci. Its activity is based on the inhibition of a demethylation step in the ergosterol biosynthesis. Ergosterol, the end-product of the biosynthetic pathway and the main sterol in yeast and fungi. The disruption in production of ergosterol disrupts the fungal cell membrane, causing holes to appear in it. These holes allow the essential constituents of the fungal cells to leak out and ultimately the fungal cells die. Pharmacokinetics : The oral bioavailability of Miconazole is low (25-30%) because there is little absorption of Miconazole from the intestinal tract. Miconazole is systemically absorbed after administration as the oral gel. Absorbed Miconazole is bound to plasma proteins (88.2%), primarily to serum albumin and red blood cells (10.6%). The absorbed portion of Miconazole oral gel is largely metabolized; less than 1% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. The terminal plasma half-life is 20-25 hours in most patients. The elimination half-life of Miconazole is similar in any renal impaired patient.",

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Symptoms : Symptoms of A-One XR overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of A-One XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma A-One XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of A-One XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures.

        "pharmacology": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

Read more Antioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows: β carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with β carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",
        "pharmacology": "Beta carotene of this tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity. Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption. vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.",

        "contraindications": "Carocet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.",
        "side_effects": "β carotene is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids. Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation. Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.",

        "pharmacology": "Albendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activities. The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Adults & children over 2 years : 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) as a single dose in cases of Enterobius vermicularis, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. In cases of strongyloidiasis or taeniasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) daily should be given for 3 consecutive days. If the patient is not cured on follow-up after three weeks, a second course of treatment is indicated. Children of 1-2 years : Recommended dose is a single dose of 200 mg (5 ml suspension). Children under 1 year : Not recommended. In Hydatid disease (Echinococcosis) : Albendazole is given by mouth with meals in a dose of 400 mg twice daily for 28 days for patients weighing over 60 kg. A dose of 15 mg/kg body weight daily in two divided doses (to a maximum total daily dose of 800 mg) is used for patients weighing less than 60 kg. For cystic echinococcosis, the 28 days course may be repeated after 14 days without treatment, to a total of 3 treatment cycles. For alveolar echinococcosis, cycles of 28 days of treatment followed by 14 days without treatment, may need to continue for months or years. In giardiasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) once daily for five days is used.",

Prolonged use of Abaclor may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. As with other β-lactam antibiotics, the renal excretion of Abaclor is inhibited by Probenecid. Antibiotics, including Cephalosporins, should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Before therapy with Abaclor is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous hypersensitivity reactions to Abaclor, Cephalosporins, Penicillins or other drugs. If Abaclor is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients, caution should be exercised. Abaclor should be administered cautiously to any patient who has demonstrated some form of allergy, particularly to drugs.",

        "indications": "This kit is indicated for early Menstrual Regulation (MR)/termination of pregnancy up to 9 weeks (63 days) of gestation.",
        "pharmacology": "Mifepristone: Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with anti-progestational activity results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species, the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone and the Menstrual Regulation (MR) results. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins. Misoprostol: Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1. It causes myometrial contraction by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction. By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "This can only be prescribed by qualified medical professionals who are able to assess the gestational age of an embryo and to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. The qualified medical professionals must also be able to provide surgical Intervention/MVA (Manual Vaccum Aspiration) in cases of incomplete abortion or severe bleeding or have made plans to provide such care through others and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary. Day 1 (First visit) : Mifepristone administration: One tablet of Mifepristone (200 mg) is taken in a single oral dose under the supervision of a qualified medical professional in a clinic, medical office or hospital. Day 2 (Second visit) : Misoprostol administration: 24-48 hours after ingesting the Mifepristone tablet, the patient takes four 200 microgram tablets (800 micrograms) of Misoprostol buccally or sublingually. Misoprostol tablets can be administered by the patient herself (place two tablets on each side of cheeck & gum or under the tongue). She should wait for 30 minutes. During the period immediately following the administration of Misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient should be given instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive bleeding or other adverse reactions occur and should be given a phone number to call if she has questions following the administration of Misoprostol. Day 10 to 14 (Third visit) : Post-treatment examination: Patients must return to the clinic, medical office or hospital within 10 to 14 days after the administration of mifepristone. This visit is very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at this visit have a risk of fetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/termination of pregnancy failures.",
        "contraindications": "Administration of Mifepristone is contraindicated in patients with any one of the following conditions: History of allergy or known hypersensitivity to Mifepristone, Misoprostol or other prostaglandin, confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy or undiagnosed adnexal mass (the treatment procedure will not be effective to terminate an ectopic pregnancy), IUD in place, chronic adrenal failure, haemorrhagic disorders or concurrent anticoagulant therapy, inherited porphyria, If a patient does not have adequate access to medical facilities equipped to provide emergency treatment of incomplete process, blood transfusions and emergency resuscitation during the period from the first visit until discharged by the administering physician.",
        "side_effects": "Mifepristone: The treatment procedure is designed to induce vaginal bleeding and uterine cramping necessary for Menstrual Regulation (MR). Commonly reported side effects were nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Pelvic pain, fainting, headache, dizziness, and asthenia occurred rarely. Misoprostol: Gastro-intestinal side-effects like diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, dyspepsia, headache, vomiting and constipation, shivering, hyperthermia, dizziness, pain due to uterine contractions, severe vaginal bleeding, shock, pelvic pain, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy and/or salpingo-oophorectomy).",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Pregnancy- Mifepristone : is indicated for Menstrual Regulation (MR) (through 63 days pregnancy) and has no other approved indication for use during pregnancy. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at the last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR) treatment failures. Lactation- Mifepristone : It is not known whether Mifepristone is excreted through human milk. Many hormones with a similar chemical structure, however, are excreted in breast milk. Since the effects of Mifepristone on infants are unknown, breast-feeding women should consult with their doctor to decide if they should discard their breast milk for a few days following administration of the medications. Misoprostol : Although it is not known whether Misoprostol or Misoprostol is excreted through human milk, Misoprostol should not be administered to nursing mothers because the potential excretion of misoprostol acid could cause diarrhoea in nursing infants.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "The patient should not give combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol to anyone else. The combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, it may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she is or were to become pregnant. Any Intra Uterine Device [IUD] should be removed before treatment with Mifepristone begins. Menstrual Regulation (MR) by surgery is recommended in cases when combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol fails to cause Menstrual Regulation (MR). Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/ termination of pregnancy failures.",
        "overdose_effects": "Mifepristone: No serious adverse reactions were reported in tolerance studies in healthy nonpregnant female and healthy male subjects where Mifepristone was administered in single doses greater than threefold of 600mg for Menstrual Regulation (MR). If a patient ingests a massive overdose, she should be observed closely for signs of adrenal failure. Misoprostol: Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are a sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, palpitations, hypotension or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. However, because Misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be the appropriate treatment for overdosage."

        "unit_price": "৳ 35.00",
        "indications": "Abacten is indicated for infections (caused by susceptible organisms) in lower respiratory tract infections including bronchitis and pneumonia, in upper respiratory tract infections including sinusitis and pharyngitis/tonsillitis, in otitis media, and in skin and soft tissue infections. In sexually transmitted diseases in men and women, Abacten is indicated in the treatment of non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis.",
        "pharmacology": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections: Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms : Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms : Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae Other microorganisms : Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity. Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms : Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms : Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila Anaerobic microorganisms : Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia",

        "contraindications": "Azithromycin Dihydrate is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to Azithromycin or any other macrolide antibiotic. Co-administration of ergot derivatives and Azithromycin is contraindicated. Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic diseases.",
        "side_effects": "Abacten is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects. Most side-effects observed were mild to moderate in severity. The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Pregnancy Category of Azithromycin Dihydrate is B. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated that Azithromycin has no evidence of harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if adequate alternatives are not available. It is not known whether Azithromycin is secreted in breast milk. So, caution should be exercised when Azithromycin is administered to nursing women.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "As with erythromycin and other macrolides, rare serious allergic reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis, has been reported. Some of these reactions with azithromycin have resulted in recurrent symptoms and required a long period of observation and treatment.",
        "overdose_effects": "There is no data on overdosage with Abacten. Typical symptoms of overdosage with macrolide antibiotics include hearing loss, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Gastric lavage and general supportive measures are indicated."

        "pharmacology": "Atorvastatin is a selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface for enhanced uptake and catabolism of LDL. Absorption : Atorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to Atorvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of Atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%. Distribution : Mean volume of distribution of Atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, Atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk. Metabolism : Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of Atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of Atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozymes. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion : Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of Atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of Atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Primary hypercholesterolaemia and combined hyperlipidaemia- Adults : Usually 10 mg once daily; if necessary, may be increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to max. 80 mg once daily. Child (10-18 years) : Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 20 mg once daily. Familial hypercholesterolaemia- Adults : Initially 10 mg daily, increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to 40 mg once daily; if necessary, further increased to max. 80 mg once daily (or 40 mg once daily combined with anion-exchange resin in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia). Child (10-18 years) : Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 80 mg once daily. Prevention of cardiovascular events- Adults : Initially 10 mg once daily adjusted according to response. Another guideline : The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet before receiving Atorvastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment with Atorvastatin. The recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of Atorvastatin is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. After initiation of Atorvastatin lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. In hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10-17 years of age) the recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.",

Maternal treatment with atorvastatin may reduce the fetal levels of mevalonate which is a precursor of cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin should not be used in women who are pregnant, trying to become pregnant or suspect they are pregnant. Treatment with atorvastatin should be suspended for the duration of pregnancy or until it has been determined that the woman is not pregnant Lactation : It is not known whether atorvastatin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.

This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions: 1. The conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17 α-hydroxy derivatives by 17 α-hydroxylase activity and 2. The subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by Abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor. Abiraterone Acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial. It is not necessary to monitor the effect of Abiraterone Acetate on serum testosterone levels.

For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, hold Abiraterone Acetate until recovery. Retreatment may be initated at a reduced dose. Abiraterone Acetate should be discontinued if patients develop severe hepatotoxicity. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Rifampin, Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Phenobarbital) during Abiraterone Acetate treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the Abiraterone Acetate dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co-administration period (e.g., from 1,000 mg once daily to 1,000 mg twice a day).

Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.",

In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Abetis.",
        "overdose_effects": "There is no experience of overdose with Abetis. The most likely effects of Abetis overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Abetis requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output."

Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient’s risk.",
        "pharmacology": "Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Olmesartan Medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin).",

        "pharmacology": "Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Dosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily. No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food. Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.",

In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Abetis.",
        "overdose_effects": "There is no experience of overdose with Abetis. The most likely effects of Abetis overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Abetis requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output."

Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient’s risk.",
        "pharmacology": "Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Amlodipine has a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the Renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that Olmesartan Medoxomil is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor. Olmesartan Medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin).",

This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions: 1. The conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17 α-hydroxy derivatives by 17 α-hydroxylase activity and 2. The subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by Abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor. Abiraterone Acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial.

For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, hold Abiraterone Acetate until recovery. Retreatment may be initated at a reduced dose. Abiraterone Acetate should be discontinued if patients develop severe hepatotoxicity. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Rifampin, Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Phenobarbital) during Abiraterone Acetate treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the Abiraterone Acetate dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co-administration period (e.g., from 1,000 mg once daily to 1,000 mg twice a day).

Memantine is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect through its action as a low to moderate affinity as an uncompetitive (open-channel) NMDA receptor antagonist which binds preferentially to the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels. Memantine is well absorbed after oral administration and has linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range. It is excreted predominantly unchanged in the urine and has a terminal elimination half-life of about 60-80 hours. Following oral administration, Memantine is highly absorbed with peak concentrtions reached in about 3-7 hours. Food has no effect on the absorption of Memantine. The mean volume of distribution of Memantine is 9-11 L/kg and the plasma protein binding is low (45%). emantine undergoes partial hepatic metabolism. About 48% of administered drug is excreted unchanged in urine; the remainder is converted primarily to three polar metabolites which possess minimal NMDA receptor antagonistic activity: the N-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy Memantine and 1-nitroso-deaminated Memantine. A total of 74% of the administered dose is excreted as the sum of the parent drug and the N-glucuronide conjugate. The hepatic microsomal CYP-450 enzyme system does not play a significant role in the metabolism of Memantine.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "The recommended maintenance dose of Memantine for adults and older patients is 20 mg every day. In order to lower the risk of side effects, the dose should be achieved by upward titration with 5 mg per week over 3 weeks, achieving the maintenance dose of 20 mg/day from the start of week 4 according to the following dosage guideline: Week 1 (Everyday) : Morning- 5 mg (1 tablet), Night- No dose Week 2 (Everyday) : Morning- 5 mg (1 tablet), Night- 5 mg (1 tablet) Week 3 (Everyday) : Morning- 10 mg (2 tablets), Night- 5 mg (1 tablet) Week 4 and onwards (Everyday) : Morning- 10 mg (2 tablets), Night- 10 mg (2 tablets) Missed Dose : If any dose is missed, just wait and take the next dose at the usual time. Do not double the dose to compensate for the missed dose. In case renal impairment : In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-49 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg (1 ml solution, equivalent to two downward strokes). If tolerated well after at least 7 days of treatment, the dose could be increased up to 20 mg/day according to standard titration scheme. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5-29 ml/min) daily dose should be 10 mg (1 ml solution, equivalent to two downward strokes) per day. In case of hepatic impairment : In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impaired function, no dosage adjustment is needed. Administration of memantine is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Children under 18 years : Memantine is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy.",
        "contraindications": "Memantine Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Memantine Hydrochloride or to any excipients used in the formulation.",
        "side_effects": "Most frequent side effects (frequency of 2% or less) include hallucination, confusion, dizziness, headache and fatigue. Occasional side effects include anxiety, hypertonus (heightened muscle tension), vomiting, bladder infections and increased sexual drive. If there is a history of epileptic seizures, there is a slight chance that Abixa may increase the probability of an attack.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Pregnancy Category B. Yet there are no adequate and well controlled studies of Memantine in pregnant women. Memantine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Memantine is excreted in human breast milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Memantine is administered to a nursing mother.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Caregivers should be instructed in the recommended administration (twice per day for doses above 5 mg) and dose escalation (minimum interval of one week between dose increases). If the patients suffer from kidney dysfunction, the kidney function should be monitored at regular basis. Seizures: Abixa has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. One clinical trial shows that seizures occurred in 0.2% of patients treated with Abixa and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility: Study shows that no risk of carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and impairment of fertility are caused after Abixa use. Operating Vehicles or Machinery : Taking Abixa may alter the reaction time significantly; therefore safe driving and safe operation of machinery may no longer be possible.",

        "pharmacology": "Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, Kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. An AT 2 receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT 1 receptor than for the AT 2 receptor. Olmesartan medoxomil does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Dosage must be individualized. The usual recommended starting dose of Olmesartan is 20 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-contracted. For patients requiring further reduction in blood pressure after 2 weeks of therapy, the dose of Olmesartan may be increased to 40 mg. Doses above 40 mg do not appear to have a greater effect. Twice-daily dosing offers no advantage over the same total dose given once daily. No initial dosage adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, for patients with moderate to marked renal impairment (creatinine clearance <40 ml/min) or with moderate to marked hepatic dysfunction. For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume (e.g. patients treated with diuretics, particularly those with impaired renal function), Olmesartan should be initiated under close medical supervision and consideration should be given to use of a lower starting dose. Olmesartan may be administered with or without food. Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established.",

        "side_effects": "Abetis has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. Treatment with Abetis was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to placebo. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was not dose related. Analysis of gender, age and race groups demonstrated no differences between Abetis and placebo treated patients. The rate of withdrawals due to adverse reactions in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.4% of patients treated with Abetis and 2.7% of control patients. In placebo controlled trials, the only adverse reaction that occurred in more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis and at a higher incidence versus placebo was dizziness (3% vs. 1%) The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence of more than 1% of patients treated with Abetis, but also occurred at about the same or greater incidence in patients receiving placebo: back pain, bronchitis, creatine phosphokinase increased, diarrhea, headache, hematuria, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, rhinitis and sinusitis.

It is not known whether Olmesartan is excreted in human milk, but Olmesartan is secreted at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with Abetis. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results may be anticipated in patients treated with Abetis.",
        "overdose_effects": "There is no experience of overdose with Abetis. The most likely effects of Abetis overdosage are hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could be encountered if parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation occurred. If intake is recent, gastric lavage or induction of emesis may be considered. Clinically significant hypotension due to an overdose of Abetis requires the active support of the cardiovascular system, including close monitoring of heart and lung function, the elevation of the extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output."

        "pharmacology": "Abiraterone Acetate is converted in vivo to Abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, that inhibits 17 α-hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase (CYP17). This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions: 1. The conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17 α-hydroxy derivatives by 17 α-hydroxylase activity and 2. The subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by Abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor. Abiraterone Acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial. It is not necessary to monitor the effect of Abiraterone Acetate on serum testosterone levels. Changes in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels may be observed but have not been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in individual patients.",

For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment, hold Abiraterone Acetate until recovery. Retreatment may be initated at a reduced dose. Abiraterone Acetate should be discontinued if patients develop severe hepatotoxicity. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Rifampin, Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Phenobarbital) during Abiraterone Acetate treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the Abiraterone Acetate dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co-administration period (e.g., from 1,000 mg once daily to 1,000 mg twice a day).

        "pharmacology": "Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma. Maximum plasma concentrations of Misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of Misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid. Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents. Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 meg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of Misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Benign gastric and duodenal ulceration and NSAID associated ulceration : 800 mcg daily (in 2-4 divided doses) with breakfast or main meals and at bedtime; treatment should be continued for at least 4 weeks and may be continued for up to 8 weeks if required. Prophylaxis of NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcer : 200 mcg 2-4 times daily taken with NSAID. If this dose cannot be tolerated, a dose of 100 mcg can be used. Misoprostol should be taken for the duration of NSAID therapy as prescribed by the physician. Induction of labor : Place 25 mcg in the posterior fornix of the vagina. Repeat after every 6 hours if necessary until the maximum dosage of 200 mcg total misoprostol is reached. Fetal heart rate and uterus contractions should be monitored. Alternatively, 100 mcg taken orally. If cervical ripening or active labor does not occur, repeated dose of 100-200 mcg of oral misoprostol is given every 4 hourly until labor is established (as evidenced by a Bishop score of 7 or more). Maximum number of dose is 6. Maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate and contractions should be monitored. Oxytocin can be started 4 hours after last dose of misoprostol. Physician should be notified for signs of fetal distress or tetanic uterine contractions. Oral misoprostol therapy should be monitored by Physician. Prevention of postpartum hemorrhage : 600 mcg orally immediately following delivery. Treatment of postpartum hemorrhage : 600 mcg orally or 1000 mcg per rectally.",
        "contraindications": "Misoprostol is contraindicated to anyone with a history of allergy to prostaglandins and it is also contraindicated in pregnancy.",
        "side_effects": "Generally, Aboprost is well tolerated. The most frequent adverse effects associated with Aboprost therapy involve the GI tract such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, rashes and dizziness. The incidence of diarrhea may be minimized by administering the drug after meal and at bedtime and by avoiding concomitant administration with a magnesium-containing or other laxative antacid.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Because of the abortifacient property of the Misoprostol component, it is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. It should not be used in women of childbearing potential unless the patient requires nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy and is at high risk of developing gastric or duodenal ulceration or for developing complications from gastric or duodenal ulcers associated with the use of the NSAID. In such patients, it may be prescribed if the patient: has had a negative serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning therapy. is capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. has received both oral and written warnings of the hazards of Misoprostol, the risk of possible contraception failure, and the danger to other women of childbearing potential should the drug be taken by mistake. will begin it only on the second or third day of the next normal menstrual period. Excretion of the active metabolite (Misoprostol acid) into milk is possible but has not been studied. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, it is not recommended for use by nursing mothers.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "In case of prevention and treatment of NSAID induced gastric and duodenal ulcer : Aboprost is contraindicated in women who are pregnant, and should not be used in women of child bearing potential unless the patient requires NSAID therapy. Women of child bearing potential should be told that they must not be pregnant when Aboprost therapy is initiated and they must use an effective contraception method while taking Aboprost. In case of induction of labor : The pregnancy should have completed 38 weeks gestation by reliable dating, or lung maturity as evidenced by a L/S >2.0 or a positive phosphotidyl glycerol test, or completed 36 weeks gestation with a maternal or fetal medical indication for induction of labor. Induction of labor is contraindicated in acute fetal distress, abruptio placenta, placenta previa or unexplained vaginal bleeding. The fetus should be in vertex presentation.",

        "pharmacology": "Mifepristone: Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with anti-progestational activity results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species, the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone and the Menstrual Regulation (MR) results. During pregnancy, the compound sensitizes the myometrium to the contraction-inducing activity of prostaglandins. Misoprostol: Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1. It causes myometrial contraction by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction. By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "This can only be prescribed by qualified medical professionals who are able to assess the gestational age of an embryo and to diagnose ectopic pregnancies. The qualified medical professionals must also be able to provide surgical Intervention/MVA (Manual Vaccum Aspiration) in cases of incomplete abortion or severe bleeding or have made plans to provide such care through others and be able to assure patient access to medical facilities equipped to provide blood transfusions and resuscitation, if necessary. Day 1 (First visit) : Mifepristone administration: One tablet of Mifepristone (200 mg) is taken in a single oral dose under the supervision of a qualified medical professional in a clinic, medical office or hospital. Day 2 (Second visit) : Misoprostol administration: 24-48 hours after ingesting the Mifepristone tablet, the patient takes four 200 microgram tablets (800 micrograms) of Misoprostol buccally or sublingually. Misoprostol tablets can be administered by the patient herself (place two tablets on each side of cheeck & gum or under the tongue). She should wait for 30 minutes. During the period immediately following the administration of Misoprostol, the patient may need medication for cramps or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient should be given instructions on what to do if significant discomfort, excessive bleeding or other adverse reactions occur and should be given a phone number to call if she has questions following the administration of Misoprostol. Day 10 to 14 (Third visit) : Post-treatment examination: Patients must return to the clinic, medical office or hospital within 10 to 14 days after the administration of mifepristone. This visit is very important to confirm by clinical examination or ultrasonographic scan that a complete termination of pregnancy has occurred. Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at this visit have a risk of fetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/termination of pregnancy failures.",

        "side_effects": "Mifepristone: The treatment procedure is designed to induce vaginal bleeding and uterine cramping necessary for Menstrual Regulation (MR). Commonly reported side effects were nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Pelvic pain, fainting, headache, dizziness, and asthenia occurred rarely. Misoprostol: Gastro-intestinal side-effects like diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, dyspepsia, headache, vomiting and constipation, shivering, hyperthermia, dizziness, pain due to uterine contractions, severe vaginal bleeding, shock, pelvic pain, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy and/or salpingo-oophorectomy).",

Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at the last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR) treatment failures. Lactation- Mifepristone : It is not known whether Mifepristone is excreted through human milk. Many hormones with a similar chemical structure, however, are excreted in breast milk. Since the effects of Mifepristone on infants are unknown, breast-feeding women should consult with their doctor to decide if they should discard their breast milk for a few days following administration of the medications. Misoprostol : Although it is not known whether Misoprostol or Misoprostol is excreted through human milk, Misoprostol should not be administered to nursing mothers because the potential excretion of misoprostol acid could cause diarrhoea in nursing infants.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "The patient should not give combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol to anyone else. The combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol has been prescribed for the patient's specific condition, it may not be the correct treatment for another person, and may be dangerous to the other person if she is or were to become pregnant. Any Intra Uterine Device [IUD] should be removed before treatment with Mifepristone begins. Menstrual Regulation (MR) by surgery is recommended in cases when combination of Mifepristone & Misoprostol fails to cause Menstrual Regulation (MR). Patients who have an ongoing pregnancy at last visit have a risk of foetal malformation resulting from the treatment. Surgical termination/MVA is recommended to manage Menstrual Regulation (MR)/ termination of pregnancy failures.",
        "overdose_effects": "Mifepristone: No serious adverse reactions were reported in tolerance studies in healthy nonpregnant female and healthy male subjects where Mifepristone was administered in single doses greater than threefold of 600mg for Menstrual Regulation (MR). If a patient ingests a massive overdose, she should be observed closely for signs of adrenal failure. Misoprostol: Clinical signs that may indicate an overdose are a sedation, tremor, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, palpitations, hypotension or bradycardia. Symptoms should be treated with supportive therapy. However, because Misoprostol is metabolized like a fatty acid, it is unlikely that dialysis would be the appropriate treatment for overdosage."

Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Symptoms : Symptoms of Ace Power overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace Power overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace Power concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace Power. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

In sexually transmitted diseases in men and women, Accuzith is indicated in the treatment of non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis.",
        "pharmacology": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections: Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms : Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms : Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae Other microorganisms : Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity.

The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.",

        "precautions_and_warnings": "Care is advised in the administration of Ace to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace-containing products concurrently. Ace should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary. Administration of Ace in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Ace. Use caution when administering Ace in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Ace IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Ace IV in patients with Ace allergy.",
        "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms : Symptoms of Ace overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

Read more A glucose meter, also referred to as a \"glucometer\", is a medical device for determining the approximate concentration of glucose in the blood. It can also be a strip of glucose paper dipped into a substance and measured to the glucose chart. It is a key element of glucose testing, including home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) performed by people with diabetes mellitus or hypoglycemia. A small drop of blood, obtained from slightly piercing a fingertip with a lancet, is placed on a disposable test strip that the meter reads and uses to calculate the blood glucose level. The meter then displays the level in units of mg/dL or mmol/L. Since approximately 1980, a primary goal of the management of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus has been achieving closer-to-normal levels of glucose in the blood for as much of the time as possible, guided by HBGM several times a day. The benefits include a reduction in the occurrence rate and severity of long-term complications from hyperglycemia as well as a reduction in the short-term, potentially life-threatening complications of hypoglycemia.",

Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Care is advised in the administration of Ace to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Ace-containing products concurrently. Ace should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary. Administration of Ace in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Ace. Use caution when administering Ace in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Ace IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Ace IV in patients with Ace allergy.",
        "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms : Symptoms of Ace overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

        "indications": "Acaril is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
        "pharmacology": "In contrast to sulfonylureas, Acarbose does not enhance insulin secretion. The antihyperglycemic action of acarbose results from a competitive, reversible inhibition of pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucoside hydrolase enzymes. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, while the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine. In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in a delayed glucose absorption and a lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia. Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of Acarbose to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin when used in combination. In addition, Acarbose diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas. Acarbose has no inhibitory activity against lactase and consequently would not be expected to induce lactose intolerance.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "The recommended starting dosage of Acarbose is 25 mg given orally three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. However, some patients may benefit from more gradual dose titration to minimize gastrointestinal side effects. This may be achieved by initiating treatment at 25 mg once per day and subsequently increasing the frequency of administration to achieve 25 mg t.i.d. Maintenance Dosage Once a 25 mg t.i.d. dosage regimen is reached, dosage of Acarbose should be adjusted at 4–8 week intervals based on one-hour postprandial glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and on tolerance. The dosage can be increased from 25 mg t.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d. Some patients may benefit from further increasing the dosage to 100 mg t.i.d. The maintenance dose ranges from 50 mg t.i.d. to 100 mg t.i.d.",
        "contraindications": "Acarbose is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug. Precose is contraindicated in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or cirrhosis. Acarbose is also contraindicated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration, partial intestinal obstruction or in patients predisposed to intestinal obstruction. In addition, Acarbose is contraindicated in patients who have chronic intestinal diseases associated with marked disorders of digestion or absorption and in patients who have conditions that may deteriorate as a result of increased gas formation in the intestine.",
        "side_effects": "Diarrhea, gas, upset stomach, constipation, or stomach pain may occur in the first few weeks of treatment as your body adjusts to this medication but usually improve with time. Follow your prescribed diet to help lessen these side effects. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Pregnancy Category B. The safety of Acarbose in pregnant women has not been established. A small amount of radioactivity has been found in the milk of lactating rats after administration of radiolabeled acarbose. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, Acarbose should not be administered to a nursing woman.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Because of its mechanism of action, Acaril when administered alone should not cause hypoglycemia in the fasted or postprandial state. Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia. Because Acaril given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood glucose, it may increase the potential for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, and no increased incidence of hypoglycemia was observed in patients when Acaril was added to metformin therapy. Oral glucose (dextrose), whose absorption is not inhibited by Acaril, should be used instead of sucrose (cane sugar) in the treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia. Sucrose, whose hydrolysis to glucose and fructose is inhibited by Acaril, is unsuitable for the rapid correction of hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia may require the use of either intravenous glucose infusion or glucagon injection.",
        "overdose_effects": "Unlike sulfonylureas or insulin, an overdose of Acaril will not result in hypoglycemia. An overdose may result in transient increases in flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort which shortly subside. In cases of overdosage the patient should not be given drinks or meals containing carbohydrates (polysaccharides, oligosaccharides and disaccharides) for the next 4–6 hours."

Read more A glucose meter, also referred to as a \"glucometer\", is a medical device for determining the approximate concentration of glucose in the blood. It can also be a strip of glucose paper dipped into a substance and measured to the glucose chart. It is a key element of glucose testing, including home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) performed by people with diabetes mellitus or hypoglycemia. A small drop of blood, obtained from slightly piercing a fingertip with a lancet, is placed on a disposable test strip that the meter reads and uses to calculate the blood glucose level. The meter then displays the level in units of mg/dL or mmol/L. Since approximately 1980, a primary goal of the management of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus has been achieving closer-to-normal levels of glucose in the blood for as much of the time as possible, guided by HBGM several times a day. The benefits include a reduction in the occurrence rate and severity of long-term complications from hyperglycemia as well as a reduction in the short-term, potentially life-threatening complications of hypoglycemia.",

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

        "indications": "Accuzith is indicated for infections (caused by susceptible organisms) in lower respiratory tract infections including bronchitis and pneumonia, in upper respiratory tract infections including sinusitis and pharyngitis/tonsillitis, in otitis media, and in skin and soft tissue infections. In sexually transmitted diseases in men and women, Accuzith is indicated in the treatment of non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis.",
        "pharmacology": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections: Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms : Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms : Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae Other microorganisms : Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity.

The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.",

There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if adequate alternatives are not available. It is not known whether Azithromycin is secreted in breast milk. So, caution should be exercised when Azithromycin is administered to nursing women.",

        "indications": "Ace is indicated for fever, common cold and influenza, headache, toothache, earache, bodyache, myalgia, neuralgia, dysmenorrhoea, sprains, colic pain, back pain, post-operative pain, postpartum pain, inflammatory pain and post vaccination pain in children. It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Administration of Ace in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Ace. Use caution when administering Ace in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Ace IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Ace IV in patients with Ace allergy.",
        "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Ace. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Ace may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms : Symptoms of Ace overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Ace overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Ace concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Ace. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

        "pharmacology": "This is the mixture of non-systemic acid neutralizing substances and antiflatulent. This preparation offers reliability as well as long action. Aluminium Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide induce the relief of ulcer by neutralizing gastric acid secreted from parietal cells of the stomach. The clinical use of simethicone is based on its antifoam properties. Simethicone spreads on the surface of aqueous liquids, forming a film of low surface tension and causing collapse of foam bubbles. Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Symptoms : Symptoms of Acep overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Acep overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Acep concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Acep. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

When Coombs testing is performed on neonates whose mothers received cephalosporins prior to labour, it should be noted that a positive result may be due to the drug. Acefra may cause a false positive urine glucose result when Benedict’s or Fehling’s solutions or tablets such as Clinitest are used in the testing. This does not occur with enzyme-based tests (e.g. Clinistix, Diastix). Dosage adjustment is necessary in renal impairment. Acefra contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.",
        "overdose_effects": "The symptoms of Sefrad overdose are non-specific and are generally nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and gastric upsets. Treatment is mainly supportive although gastric lavage will be necessary if a large amount has been ingested."

        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Symptoms : Symptoms of Acep overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Acep overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Acep concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Acep. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Symptoms : Symptoms of Aceta One overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceta One overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceta One concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceta One. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Symptoms : Symptoms of Aceto overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceto overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceto concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceto. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

There is no experience of the effect of Acyclovir on human fertility.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Acerux IV injection is intended for intravenous infusion only and should not be used through any other route. Reconstituted Acerux IV Infusion has a pH of approximately 11.0 and should not be administered by mouth. Acerux IV injection as infusion must be given over a period of at least one hour in order to avoid renal tubular damage. It should not be administered as a bolus injection. Acerux IV infusion must be accompanied by adequate hydration. Since maximum urine concentration occurs within the first few hours following infusion, particular attention should be given to establish sufficient urine ‑ow during that period. Concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs, pre-existing renal disease and dehydration increase the risk of further renal impairment by Acerux. As Acerux has been associated with reversible encephalopathic changes, it should be used with caution in patients with neurological abnormalities, significant hypoxia or serious renal, hepatic or electrolyte abnormalities.",
        "overdose_effects": "Overdosage of intravenous Acerux has resulted in elevations of serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and subsequent renal failure. Neurological effects including confusion, hallucinations, agitation, seizures and coma have been described in association with over dosage. Adequate hydration is essential to reduce the possibility of crystal formation in the urine. Hemodialysis significantly enhances the removal of Acerux from the blood and may, therefore, be considered an option in the management of overdose of Acerux."

Thus vitamin C helps in faster recovery after surgery or any other trauma. Vitamin C quenches free radicals in the water based cellular components and thus acts as an antioxidant. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, which is stored in the liver, adipose tissues, heart, muscles etc. It is an active antioxidant, which prevents oxidation of fat compounds. It works in synergy with Selenium. Vitamin K is a key anti-aging vitamin and it prevents heart disease and osteoporosis. Zinc is an important mineral that can actually rejuvenate the shrinking thymus gland that involves the working of the immune system. Zinc is a co-factor in over 100 enzymes of the body. Selenium: Apart from being a co-factor in antioxidant enzymes, Selenium by itself has potent antioxidant capabilities. So, it prevents aging and hardening of tissues through oxidation. Vitamin E and Selenium are synergistic and seem to potentiate each other's antioxidant activities. Copper is an important co-factor of a number of enzymes present in our body. This enzymes act as endogenous antioxidant systems. Manganese , an antioxidant, is one of the minerals required to form SOD (Super Oxide Dismutase).

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Symptoms : Symptoms of Aceta-PD overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceta-PD overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceta-PD concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceta-PD. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

Symptoms : Symptoms of Aceta Extend overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceta Extend overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceta Extend concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceta Extend. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. In cell culture, Acyclovir Triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA. This inhibition is accomplished in 3 ways: Competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase Incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain Inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase Hydrocortisone is the main glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex.

Patients should be advised not to take other Aceta-containing products concurrently. Aceta should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary. Administration of Aceta in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Aceta. Use caution when administering Aceta in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Aceta IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Aceta IV in patients with Aceta allergy.",
        "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Aceta. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Aceta may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms : Symptoms of Aceta overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Aceta overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Aceta concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Aceta. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance. Proton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10–40%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium. A risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded.

Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment. Influence on vitamin B12 absorption : Acifix, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) : Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Acifix. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors. Interference with laboratory tests : Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Acifix 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements.

        "precautions_and_warnings": "Symptomatic response to therapy with Acipra does not preclude the presence of gastric or oesophageal malignancy, therefore the possibility of malignancy should be excluded prior to commencing treatment with Acipra 20 mg Gastro-resistant Tablets. Patients on long-term treatment (particularly those treated for more than a year) should be kept under regular surveillance. Proton pump inhibitors, especially if used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10–40%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium. A risk of cross-hypersensitivity reactions with other proton pump inhibitor or substituted benzimidazoles cannot be excluded. Patients should be cautioned that Acipra gastro-resistant tablets should not be chewed or crushed, but should be swallowed whole. There have been post marketing reports of blood dyscrasias (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole. Hepatic enzyme abnormalities have been seen in clinical trials and have also been reported since market authorisation. In the majority of cases where an alternative aetiology cannot be identified, the events were uncomplicated and resolved on discontinuation of rabeprazole. No evidence of significant drug related safety problems was seen in a study of patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment versus normal age and sex matched controls. However because there are no clinical data on the use of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with severe hepatic dysfunction the prescriber is advised to exercise caution when treatment with Acipra 20mg Gastro-resistant. Tablets is first initiated in such patients. Co-administration of atazanavir with Acipra is not recommended. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors, including rabeprazole, may possibly increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and Clostridium difficile. Hypomagnesaemia : Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPIs like rabeprazole for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventricular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment. Influence on vitamin B12 absorption : Acipra, as all acid-blocking medicines, may reduce the absorption of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) due to hypo- or a- chlorhydria. This should be considered in patients with reduced body stores or risk factors for reduced vitamin B12 absorption on long-term therapy or if respective clinical symptoms are observed. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) : Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Acipra. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibitors. Interference with laboratory tests : Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. To avoid this interference, Acipra 20mg Gastro-resistant Tablets treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements. If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment.",
        "overdose_effects": "The maximum established exposure has not exceeded 60 mg twice daily, or 160 mg once daily. Effects are generally minimal, representative of the known adverse event profile and reversible without further medical intervention. No specific antidote is known. Acipra is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not dialysable. As in any case of overdose, treatment should be symptomatic and general supportive measures should be utilised."

        "pharmacology": "Sparfloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent that inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and kills many of the types of bacteria that can infect the breathing airways and lungs and has been shown in a large number of clinical trials to be safe and effective for the treatment of bacterial infections. It is found to be more effective in vitro than other fluoroquinolones against some gram positive organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureous), Mycobacteria and Chlamydia spp. Absorption : Quinoflox‚ is well absorbed following oral administration with an absolute oral bioavailability of 92%. The mean maximum plasma sparfloxacin concentration following a single 400-mg oral dose was approximately 1.3 (±0.2) µg/mL. The area under the curve following a single 400-mg oral dose was approximately 34 (±6.8) µg·hr/mL. Steady-state plasma concentration was achieved on the first day by giving a loading dose that was double the daily dose. Maximum plasma concentrations for a 200 mg dose were also achieved between 3 to 6 hours after administration with a mean of about 4 hours. Oral absorption of sparfloxacin is unaffected by administration with milk or food, including high fat meals. Concurrent administration of antacids containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide reduces the oral bioavailability of sparfloxacin by as much as 50%. Distribution : Upon reaching general circulation, Quinoflox‚ distributes well into the body, as reflected by the large mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vdss ) of 3.9 (±0.8) L/kg. Sparfloxacin exhibits low plasma protein binding in serum at about 45%. Sparfloxacin penetrates well into body fluids and tissues. Results of tissue and body fluid distribution studies demonstrated that oral administration of sparfloxacin produces sustained concentrations and that sparfloxacin concentrations in lower respiratory tract tissues and fluids generally exceed the corresponding plasma concentrations. The concentration of sparfloxacin in respiratory tissues (pulmonary parenchyma, bronchial wall, and bronchial mucosa) at 2 to 6 hours following standard oral dosing was approximately 3 to 6 times greater than the corresponding concentration in plasma. Concentrations in these respiratory tissues increase at up to 24 hours following dosing. Sparfloxacin is also highly concentrated into alveolar macrophages compared to plasma. Mean pleural effusion to plasma concentration ratios were 0.34 and 0.69 at 4 and 20 hours postdose, respectively. Metabolism : Quinoflox‚ is metabolised by the liver, primarily by phase II glucuronidation, to form a glucuronide conjugate. Its metabolism does not utilize or interfere with cytochrome-mediated oxidation, in particular cytochrome P450. Excretion : The total body clearance and renal clearance of Quinoflox‚ were 11.4 (±3.5) and 1.5 (±0.5) L/hr, respectively. Sparfloxacin is excreted in both the feces (50%) and urine (50%). Approximately 10% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug in patients with normal renal function.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "The recommended daily dose of Sparfloxacin‚ in patients with normal renal function is two 200 mg tablets taken on the first day as a loading dose. Thereafter, one 200 mg tablet should be taken every 24 hours for a total of 10 days of therapy (11 tablets). The recommended daily dose of Sparfloxacin‚ in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) is two 200 mg tablets taken on the first day as a loading dose. Thereafter, one 200-mg tablet should be taken every 48 hours for a total of 9 days of therapy (6 tablets).",

Conditions that may be associated with calcium deficiency include hypoparathyroidism, achlorhydria, chronic diarrhea, vitamin D deficiency, steatorrhea, sprue, pregnancy and lactation, menopause, pancreatitis, renal failure, alkalosis, and hyperphosphataemia. Acical Jr. is being used increasingly often to treat hyperphosphataemia in chronic renal failure as well as those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and haemodialysis. Many patients are unable to tolerate sufficient doses for complete phosphate control and require additional measures such as stringent dietary phosphate restriction or relatively small doses of aluminium hydroxide. Acical Jr. containing preparations can provide short-term relief of dyspeptic systems but are no longer recommended for long-term treatment of peptic ulceration. 1000 mg tablet : Elemental Acical Jr. tablet is indicated for the management of conditions associated with hyperidity and for fast relief of acid indigestion, heartburn, sour stomach and upset stomach.",
        "pharmacology": "Calcium carbonate reacts with gastric acid to produce a salt and water. For calcium carbonate the postulated chemical reaction is: CaCO 3 +2HCl = CaCl 2 +H 2 O+CO 2 . Two grams of calcium carbonate will readily bring 100 ml of hydrochloric acid to a pH above 6. The increase in gastric pH diminishes the activity of pepsin in the gastric secretion.

In pregnancy and lactation the recommended daily dose of calcium is 1200-1500 mg. In chronic renal failure the doses used vary from 2.5-9.0 gm Calcium Carbonate per day and need to be adjusted according to the individual patient. To maximize effective phosphate binding in this context the Calcium Carbonate should be given with meals. 1000 mg tablet : 2000-3000 mg tablet when symptoms occur; may be repeated hourly if needed or as directed by the physician.",

        "unit_price": "৳ 27.00",
        "indications": "Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Acmegra to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Acmegra is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.",
        "pharmacology": "Mechanism of Action : The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours. Absorption and Distribution : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced. Metabolism and Excretion : Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose). Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations : Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Erectile dysfunction : For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day. The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil : age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose. Pulmonary arterial hypertension : The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.",
        "contraindications": "Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.",

        "precautions_and_warnings": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Acmegra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Acmegra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs. Acmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications. Patients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Acmegra. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Acmegra, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted. The safety of Acmegra is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration. Acmegra should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). The safety and efficacy of combinations of Acmegra with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended. There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Acmegra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Acmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Acmegra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Acmegra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Acmegra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months; Patients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110); Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina; Patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases); Patients with sickle cell or related anemias. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Acmegra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Acmegra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Acmegra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Acmegra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Acmegra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Acmegra dosage is recommended.",
        "overdose_effects": "In studies with healthy volunteers of single doses up to 800 mg, adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses but incidence rates and severities were increased. 24 In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as Acmegra is highly bound to plasma proteins and it is not eliminated in the urine."

        "unit_price": "৳ 45.00",
        "indications": "Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Acmegra to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Acmegra is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.",
        "pharmacology": "Mechanism of Action : The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours. Absorption and Distribution : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced. Metabolism and Excretion : Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose). Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations : Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Erectile dysfunction : For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day. The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil : age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose. Pulmonary arterial hypertension : The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.",
        "contraindications": "Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.",

        "precautions_and_warnings": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Acmegra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Acmegra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs. Acmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications. Patients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Acmegra. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Acmegra, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted. The safety of Acmegra is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration. Acmegra should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia).

It is prescribed to treat severe inflammatory skin disorders such as eczema and psoriasis that have not responded to weaker corticosteroids. Neomycin Sulphate is an antibiotic of the aminoglycoside type and is used to treat infections with bacteria. Nystatin is an antifungal that kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. The mechanism of the topical steroids like Clobetasol, in general, is unclear. However, Clobetasol Propionate is highly active corticosteroid with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The major effect of Clobetasol Propionate on skin is a nonspecific anti-inflammatory response, partially due to vasoconstriction and decrease in collagen synthesis. Neomycin binds to the ribosomal 30s and 50s sub-units of susceptible bacteria and inhibits protein synthesis. Neomycin also causes a misreading of the genetic codes of the mRNA template and this causes incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of the fungus with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components.",

        "pharmacology": "Aclidinium bromide : Aclidinium bromide is a long-acting anti-muscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3 receptors at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical, in vitro as well as in vivo studies, prevention of acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The bronchodilation following inhalation of aclidinium bromide is predominantly a site-specific effect. Formoterol fumarate : Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) (beta 2-agonist). Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. The pharmacologic effects of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.",

This must be borne in mind when treating such conditions as psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus and severe eczema. If applied to the eye lids, care is needed to ensure that the preparation does not enter the eye, as glaucoma or cataract might result. Topical corticosteroids may be hazardous in psoriasis for a number of reasons including rebound relapses, development of tolerance, risk of generalised pustular psoriasis and development of local or systemic toxicity due to impaired barrier function of the skin. If used in psoriasis careful patient supervision is important. Appropriate anti-microbial therapy should be used whenever treating inflammatory lesions which have become infected. Any spread of infection requires withdrawal of topical corticosteroid therapy and systemic administration of anti-microbial agents.

It is prescribed to treat severe inflammatory skin disorders such as eczema and psoriasis that have not responded to weaker corticosteroids. Neomycin Sulphate is an antibiotic of the aminoglycoside type and is used to treat infections with bacteria. Nystatin is an antifungal that kills fungi and yeasts by interfering with their cell membranes. The mechanism of the topical steroids like Clobetasol, in general, is unclear. However, Clobetasol Propionate is highly active corticosteroid with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The major effect of Clobetasol Propionate on skin is a nonspecific anti-inflammatory response, partially due to vasoconstriction and decrease in collagen synthesis. Neomycin binds to the ribosomal 30s and 50s sub-units of susceptible bacteria and inhibits protein synthesis. Neomycin also causes a misreading of the genetic codes of the mRNA template and this causes incorrect amino acids to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain. Nystatin acts by binding to sterols in the cell membrane of the fungus with a resultant change in membrane permeability allowing leakage of intracellular components.",

Elderly : This preparation is suitable for use in elderly. Caution should be exercised in cases where a decrease in renal function exists and significant systemic absorption of Neomycin Sulphate may occur.

        "strength": "25 mg",
        "unit_price": "৳ 18.00",
        "indications": "Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Acmegra to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Acmegra is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.",
        "pharmacology": "Mechanism of Action : The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours. Absorption and Distribution : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced. Metabolism and Excretion : Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose). Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations : Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Erectile dysfunction : For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day. The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil : age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose.

        "precautions_and_warnings": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Acmegra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Acmegra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs. Acmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications. Patients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Acmegra. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Acmegra, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted. The safety of Acmegra is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration. Acmegra should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). The safety and efficacy of combinations of Acmegra with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended. There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Acmegra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Acmegra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Acmegra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Acmegra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Acmegra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months; Patients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110); Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina; Patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases); Patients with sickle cell or related anemias. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Acmegra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Acmegra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Acmegra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Acmegra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Acmegra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Acmegra dosage is recommended.",
        "overdose_effects": "In studies with healthy volunteers of single doses up to 800 mg, adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses but incidence rates and severities were increased. 24 In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as Acmegra is highly bound to plasma proteins and it is not eliminated in the urine."

        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Symptoms : Symptoms of Action XR overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Action XR overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Action XR concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Action XR. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

        "side_effects": "Side effects of Act are usually mild, though haematological reactions including thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. Pancreatitis, skin rashes, and other allergic reactions occur occasionally.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to Paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice of their doctor regarding its use. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, but not in a clinically significant amount. Available published data do not contraindicate breast feeding.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Care is advised in the administration of Act to patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. Do not exceed the stated dose. Patients should be advised not to take other Act-containing products concurrently. Act should only be used by the patient for whom it is prescribed when clearly necessary. Administration of Act in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of severe hepatotoxicity and death. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of Act. Use caution when administering Act in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Act IV immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occurs. Do not use Act IV in patients with Act allergy.",
        "overdose_effects": "Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of Act. Ingestion of 5 g or more of Act may lead to liver damage if the patient has following risk factors: If the patient is on long term treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, Primidone, Rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes, or regularly consumes Ethanol in excess of recommended amounts, or is likely to be Glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection, starvation, cachexia. Symptoms : Symptoms of Act overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Act overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Act concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Act. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

        "pharmacology": "Erythromycin inhibits microsomal protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by inhibiting the translocation process. Specific binding to the 50S subunit or 70S ribosome occurs in these organisms but there is no binding to the stable 80S mammalian ribosome. Erythromycin is active against many Grampositive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria and against mycoplasmas and chlamydia. Absorption : Erythromycin base is destroyed by acid and is therefore administered in the form of stable ester. The rates of absorption of the base and esters are diminished by the presence of food. The stearate is hydrolyzed in the intestine and the free erythromycin absorbed. Blood concentration : After an oral dose of 500 mg. of the base of stearate, peak serum concentrations of 0.9 to 1.4 or 0.4 to 1.8 mg/ml. respectively are attained in 1 to 4 hours. Half-life: The serum half-life is 1.2 to 4 hours. In subjects with oliguria, the half-life is about 5 hours. Distribution : Erythromycin is widely distributed throughout body tissue and fluids with some retention in the liver and spleen, protein binding of erythromycin base is 73%. Erythromycin enters the cerebrospinal fluid when the meninges are inflamed. It also crosses the placenta and is excreted in the milk. Excretion : 5 to 15 % of the dose of erythromycin is excreted in the urine and large amounts of the unchanged active substance are excreted in the bile.",

        "pharmacology": "Ticagrelor is a P2Y 12 receptor antagonist. The P2Y 12 receptor couples with Gα i2 and other G i proteins which inhibit adenylyl cyclase. G i mediated signalling also activates PI3K, Akt, Rap1b, and potassium channels. The downstream effects of these activities mediate hemostasis and lead to platelet aggregation. Antagonism of the P2Y 12 receptor reduces development of occlusive thromboses, which can reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Patients taking Ticagrelor should also take a daily low maintenance dose of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 75-150 mg unless specifically contraindicated. Acute coronary syndromes : Ticagrelor treatment should be initiated with a single 180 mg loading dose (two tablets of 90 mg) and then continued at 90 mg twice daily. Treatment with Ticagrelor twice daily is recommended for 12 months in ACS patients unless discontinuation is clinically indicated. History of myocardial infarction : Ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily is the recommended dose when an extended treatment is required for patients with a history of MI of at least one year and a high risk of an atherothrombotic event. Treatment may be started without interruption as continuation therapy after the initial one-year treatment with ticagrelor or another adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor therapy in ACS patients with a high risk of an atherothrombotic event. Treatment can also be initiated up to 2 years from the MI, or within one year after stopping previous ADP receptor inhibitor treatment. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor beyond 3 years of extended treatment. Switch therapy : If a switch is needed, the first dose of ticagrelor should be administered 24 hours following the last dose of the other antiplatelet medication. Missed dose : A patient who misses a dose of ticagrelor should take only one tablet (their next dose) at its scheduled time. Elderly : No dose adjustment is required in the elderly. Renal impairment : No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. No information is available concerning the treatment of patients on renal dialysis and therefore ticagrelor is not recommended in these patients. Hepatic impairment : Ticagrelor has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and its use in these patients is therefore contraindicated. Only limited information is available in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Dose adjustment is not recommended, but ticagrelor should be used with caution. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Pediatric population : The safety and efficacy of ticagrelor in hildren below the age of 18 years have not been established. No data are available. Ticagrelor can be administered with or without food. Contra-indications, warnings etc.",

        "precautions_and_warnings": "Bleeding risk : The use of Acora in patients at known increased risk for bleeding should be balanced against the benefit in terms of prevention of atherothrombotic events. If clinically indicated, Acora should be used with caution in the following patient groups; Patients with a propensity to bleed (e.g. due to recent trauma, recent surgery, coagulation disorders, active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding). Antifibrinolytic therapy (aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) and/or recombinant factor VIIa therapy may increase haemostasis. Acora may be resumed after the cause of bleeding has been identified and controlled. Surgery : Patients should be advised to inform physicians and dentists that they are taking Acora before any surgery is scheduled and before any new medicinal product is taken. If a patient is to undergo elective surgery and the antiplatelet effect is not desired, Acora should be discontinued 5 days prior to surgery. Patients with prior ischaemic stroke : ACS patients with prior ischaemic stroke can be treated with Acora for up to 12 months. Patients at risk for bradycardic events: Due to the limited clinical experience, Acora should be used with caution in these patients. Dyspnoea : Patients with asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have an increased absolute risk of experiencing dyspnoea with Acora. Acora should be used with caution in patients with a history of asthma and/or COPD. Creatinine elevations: Creatinine levels may increase during treatment with Acora. In patients with ACS, it is recommended that renal function is also checked one month after initiating the treatment with Acora, paying special attention to patients ≥75 years, patients with moderate/severe renal impairment and those receiving concomitant treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Uric acid increase: Hyperuricaemia may occur during treatment with Acora. Caution is advised in patients with a history of hyperuricaemia or gouty arthritis. Other: Based on a relationship observed in PLATO between maintenance dose of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and relative efficacy of Acora compared to clopidogrel, co-administration of Acora and high maintenance dose of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (>300 mg) is not recommended. Premature discontinuation : Premature discontinuation with any antiplatelet therapy, including Acora, could result in an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) death or MI due to the patient’s underlying disease. Therefore, premature discontinuation of treatment should be avoided.",
        "overdose_effects": "Acora is well tolerated in single doses up to 900 mg. Gastrointestinal toxicity was dose-limiting in a single ascending dose study. Other clinically meaningful adverse reactions which may occur with overdose include dyspnoea and ventricular pauses."

        "unit_price": "৳ 25.00",
        "indications": "Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Activa to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Activa is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.",
        "pharmacology": "Mechanism of Action : The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours. Absorption and Distribution : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced. Metabolism and Excretion : Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose). Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations : Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Erectile dysfunction : For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day. The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil : age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose. Pulmonary arterial hypertension : The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.",
        "contraindications": "Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.",

Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of Activa without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of Activa and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to Activa, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying 23 cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors.

        "precautions_and_warnings": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Activa, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Activa, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs. Activa has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications. Patients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Activa. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Activa, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted. The safety of Activa is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration. Activa should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). The safety and efficacy of combinations of Activa with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended. There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Activa, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Activa has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Activa, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Activa - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Activa in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months; Patients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110); Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina; Patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases); Patients with sickle cell or related anemias. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Activa. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Activa is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Activa are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Activa exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Activa (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Activa dosage is recommended.",
        "overdose_effects": "In studies with healthy volunteers of single doses up to 800 mg, adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses but incidence rates and severities were increased. 24 In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as Activa is highly bound to plasma proteins and it is not eliminated in the urine."

Calcium folinate rescue- a treatment technique using calcium folinate in conjunction with folic acid antagonists, e.g. methotrexate, to minimise systemic toxicity. The treatment of megaloblastic anaemias due to sprue, nutritional deficiency, pregnancy, infancy, liver disease and malabsorption syndrome.",
        "pharmacology": "This is the preparation of Calcium Folinate Hydrate which is calcium salt of folinic acid (5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid). It is a metabolite and active form of folic acid that is involved as a cofactor for 1-carbon transfer reactions in the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidines of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective DNA synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Because of its ready conversion to other tetrahydrofolic acid derivatives, Folinate is a potent antidote for both hematopoietic and reticuloendothelia toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, (e.g. methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim). It is postulated that in some cancers, folinate enters and \"rescues\" normal cells from the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, in preference to tumour cells, because of a difference in membrane transport mechanisms; this principle is the basis of high-dose methotrexate therapy with \"Folinate rescue\".",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Folinic Acid rescue : Folinic Acid rescue should begin as soon as possible after an inadvertent overdosage and within 24 hours of methotrexate administration when there is delayed excretion. There are no fixed guidelines regarding the dose of methotrexate that triggers an automatic subsequent Folinic Acid administration, since tolerance to this folate antagonist depends on various factors. The dose of methotrexate varies, nevertheless folinate rescue is necessary when methotrexate is given at doses exceeding 500 mg/m2 and has to be considered with doses of 100 mg-500 mg/m2. Folinic Acid rescue treatment should commence approximately 24 hours after the beginning of methotrexate infusion. Dosage regimens vary depending upon the dose of methotrexate administered. In general, Folinic Acid should be administered at a dose of 15 mg (approximately 10 mg/m2) every 6 hours for 10 doses. The recommended dose of Folinic Acid to counteract hematologic toxicity from folic acid antagonists with less affinity for mammalian dihydrofolate reductase than methotrexate (i.e., trimethoprim, pyrimethamine) is substantially less and 5 mg to 15 mg of Folinic Acid per day has been recommended. Neutralising the immediate toxic effects of folic acid antagonists : If overdosage of methotrexate is suspected, the dose of Folinic Acid should be equal to or greater than the dose of methotrexate and should be administered within one hour of the methotrexate administration. Megaloblastic anaemia (folate deficiency) : 5 mg to 15 mg of Folinic Acid per day. Use in children and adolescents : The safety and efficacy of folinic acid in children and adolescents have not been established.",
        "contraindications": "Folinic Acid is contraindicated to patients with known hypersensitivity to calcium folinate or any other components of this product. It is also contraindicated in pernicious anemia or other megaloblastic anemia where vitamin B12 is deficient. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take calcium folinate tablets.",
        "side_effects": "The most common side effects of Actifol are mucositis, stomatitis, leukopenia and/or diarrhea, which may be dose-limiting.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical studies conducted in pregnant women. Folinic Acid should only be used in pregnant women if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when calcium folinate is administered to a nursing mother.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Actifol should only be used with methotrexate or 5-FU under the direct supervision of a clinician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. In the treatment of inadvertent overdosage of a folic acid antagonist, folinate should be administered as soon as possible; if a period exceeding 4 hours intervenes, the treatment may not be effective. In general, Actifol should not be given simultaneously with folic acid antagonists, e.g. methotrexate, to abort clinical toxicity as the therapeutic effect of the antagonist may be nullified. Flowever, Actifol given concurrently with folate antagonists, such as pyrimethamine and trimethoprim does not inhibit their antibacterial activity. Measures to ensure the prompt excretion of methotrexate are important as part of Actifol Rescue Therapy. These measures include: Alkalinisation of urine so that the urinary pH is greater than 7.0 before methotrexate infusion (to increase solubility of methotrexate and its metabolites). Maintenance of urine output of 1800-2000 cc/m 2 /24 hour by increased oral or intravenous fluids on days 2, 3 and 4 following methotrexate therapy. Plasma methotrexate concentration, BUN and creatinine should be measured on days 2, 3 and 4. These measures must be continued until the plasma methotrexate level is less than 10 -7 molar.",
        "overdose_effects": "There have been no reported sequelae in patients who have received significantly more calcium folinate than the recommended dosage.

It may also be used in certain patients to make sure they are getting enough calcium (e.g. postmenopausal).",
        "pharmacology": "Calcium plays a very important role in the body. It is necessary for normal functioning of nerves, cells, muscle, and bone. If there is not enough calcium in the blood, then the body will take calcium from bones, thereby weakening bones. Having the right amount of calcium is important for building and keeping strong bones. Calcium citrate is well absorbed on an empty stomach and does not constipate. Calcium citrate is less dependent on stomach acid for absorption. Calcitriol is the most active known form of vitamin D 3 in stimulating intestinal calcium transport. It is normally formed in the kidneys from its immediate precursor, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. In physiological amounts it augments the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and plays a significant part in the regulation of bone mineralization. The defective production of calcitriol in chronic renal failure contributes to the abnormalities of mineral metabolism found in that disorder. The biological effects of calcitriol are mediated by the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear hormone receptor expressed in most cell types and functioning as a ligand-activated transcription factor that binds to DNA sites to modify the expression of target genes. Oral administration of Calcitriol to patients with chronic renal failure compensates for impaired endogenous production of calcitriol which is decreased when the glomerular filtration rate falls below 30 ml/min. Consequently, intestinal malabsorption of calcium and phosphate and the resulting hypocalcemia are improved, thereby reversing the signs and symptoms of bone disease. In patients with established post-menopausal osteoporosis, Calcitriol increases calcium absorption, elevates circulating levels of calcitriol and reduces vertebral fracture frequency.",

        "pharmacology": "Clascoterone (cortexolone 17 α-propionate) is a novel antagonist of androgen receptors. It binds to androgen receptors with high affinity. By competing with androgens for binding to androgen receptors, Clascoterone works by blocking the androgen receptor signaling cascades that promotes acne pathogenesis such as sebaceous gland proliferation, excess sebum production and inflammatory pathways. Acne is a multifactorial skin condition characterized by excess sebum production, epithelial hyperkeratinization, proliferation of the skin commensal bacteria, and inflammation. Circulating and locally synthesized natural ligands, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), serve as causative factors in both males and females. Upon binding of DHT, the DHT-androgen receptor complex dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it promotes the transcription of genes involved in acne pathogenesis, including proliferation and differentiation of sebocytes, excess sebum production, and inflammatory cytokine production. Clascoterone is a potent antagonist at ARs and competes for androgens in binding to the receptor, thereby inhibiting downstream signalling of ARs that promote acne. Androgenetic alopecia is also an androgen-dependent and highly genetic condition. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) binds to ARs expressed on dermal papilla cells (DPC) in the scalp to induce AR-mediated transcription of genes that contribute to androgenic alopecia. By blocking the interaction between DHT and aARs, clascoterone inhibits AR-regulated transcription and DHT-induced IL-6 synthesis.",

        "unit_price": "৳ 40.00",
        "indications": "Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Activa to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Activa is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.",
        "pharmacology": "Mechanism of Action : The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours. Absorption and Distribution : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced. Metabolism and Excretion : Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose). Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations : Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Erectile dysfunction : For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day. The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil : age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose. Pulmonary arterial hypertension : The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.",
        "contraindications": "Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.",

Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of Activa without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of Activa and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to Activa, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying 23 cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors.

        "precautions_and_warnings": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Activa, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Activa, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs. Activa has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications. Patients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Activa. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Activa, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted. The safety of Activa is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration. Activa should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). The safety and efficacy of combinations of Activa with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended. There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Activa, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Activa has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Activa, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Activa - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Activa in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months; Patients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110); Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina; Patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases); Patients with sickle cell or related anemias. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Activa. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Activa is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Activa are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Activa exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Activa (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Activa dosage is recommended.",
        "overdose_effects": "In studies with healthy volunteers of single doses up to 800 mg, adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses but incidence rates and severities were increased. 24 In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as Activa is highly bound to plasma proteins and it is not eliminated in the urine."

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Symptoms : Symptoms of Act overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Act overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Act concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Act. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

The treatment of megaloblastic anaemias due to sprue, nutritional deficiency, pregnancy, infancy, liver disease and malabsorption syndrome.",
        "pharmacology": "This is the preparation of Calcium Folinate Hydrate which is calcium salt of folinic acid (5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid). It is a metabolite and active form of folic acid that is involved as a cofactor for 1-carbon transfer reactions in the biosynthesis of purine and pyrimidines of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective DNA synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Because of its ready conversion to other tetrahydrofolic acid derivatives, Folinate is a potent antidote for both hematopoietic and reticuloendothelia toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, (e.g. methotrexate, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim). It is postulated that in some cancers, folinate enters and \"rescues\" normal cells from the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, in preference to tumour cells, because of a difference in membrane transport mechanisms; this principle is the basis of high-dose methotrexate therapy with \"Folinate rescue\".",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Folinic Acid rescue : Folinic Acid rescue should begin as soon as possible after an inadvertent overdosage and within 24 hours of methotrexate administration when there is delayed excretion. There are no fixed guidelines regarding the dose of methotrexate that triggers an automatic subsequent Folinic Acid administration, since tolerance to this folate antagonist depends on various factors. The dose of methotrexate varies, nevertheless folinate rescue is necessary when methotrexate is given at doses exceeding 500 mg/m2 and has to be considered with doses of 100 mg-500 mg/m2. Folinic Acid rescue treatment should commence approximately 24 hours after the beginning of methotrexate infusion. Dosage regimens vary depending upon the dose of methotrexate administered. In general, Folinic Acid should be administered at a dose of 15 mg (approximately 10 mg/m2) every 6 hours for 10 doses. The recommended dose of Folinic Acid to counteract hematologic toxicity from folic acid antagonists with less affinity for mammalian dihydrofolate reductase than methotrexate (i.e., trimethoprim, pyrimethamine) is substantially less and 5 mg to 15 mg of Folinic Acid per day has been recommended. Neutralising the immediate toxic effects of folic acid antagonists : If overdosage of methotrexate is suspected, the dose of Folinic Acid should be equal to or greater than the dose of methotrexate and should be administered within one hour of the methotrexate administration. Megaloblastic anaemia (folate deficiency) : 5 mg to 15 mg of Folinic Acid per day. Use in children and adolescents : The safety and efficacy of folinic acid in children and adolescents have not been established.",

        "precautions_and_warnings": "Actifol should only be used with methotrexate or 5-FU under the direct supervision of a clinician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. In the treatment of inadvertent overdosage of a folic acid antagonist, folinate should be administered as soon as possible; if a period exceeding 4 hours intervenes, the treatment may not be effective. In general, Actifol should not be given simultaneously with folic acid antagonists, e.g. methotrexate, to abort clinical toxicity as the therapeutic effect of the antagonist may be nullified. Flowever, Actifol given concurrently with folate antagonists, such as pyrimethamine and trimethoprim does not inhibit their antibacterial activity. Measures to ensure the prompt excretion of methotrexate are important as part of Actifol Rescue Therapy. These measures include: Alkalinisation of urine so that the urinary pH is greater than 7.0 before methotrexate infusion (to increase solubility of methotrexate and its metabolites).

        "indications": "Actidex is indicated in symptomatic treatment of pain and inflammation of mild or moderate intensity, such as musculo-skeletal pain, menstrual pain, & dental pain.",
        "pharmacology": "Dexketoprofen is the S(+)-enantiomer of Ketoprofen and is responsible for the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of Ketoprofen. The inactive R(-)-enantiomer does not contribute to the therapeutic properties of Ketoprofen but adds to the metabolic load. Dexketoprofen has been formulated as a trometamol salt. Its high solubility in water means a rapid absorption through the gut wall which results in a more rapid onset of action than Ketoprofen. Peak plasma concentrations are attained more quickly than other widely used analgesics with an onset of action of 30 minutes. Dexketoprofen trometamol, given as a tablet, is rapidly absorbed, with a time to maximum plasma concentration (t max ) of between 0.25 and 0.75 hours, whereas the t max for the S-enantiomer after the racemic drug, administered as tablets or capsules prepared with the free acid, is between 0.5 and 3 hours. Peak plasma concentrations of 1.4 and 3.1 mg/L are reached after administration of Dexketoprofen trometamol 12.5 and 25 mg, respectively. From 70 to 80% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine during the first 12 hours, mainly as the acyl-glucuronoconjugated parent drug. No R(-)-Ketoprofen is found in the urine after administration of Dexketoprofen [S(+)-Ketoprofen], confirming the absence of bioinversion of the S(+)-enantiomer in humans. The anti-inflammatory potency of Dexketoprofen was always equivalent to that demonstrated by twice the dose of Ketoprofen.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "The dose of Dexketoprofen 25 mg tablets depends on the type, severity, and duration of pain. The recommended dose is generally 1 tablet every 8 hours, with no more than 3 tablets daily. The elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment should start treatment with a total daily dose of no more than 2 tablets. Normally it is recommended to take the tablets with food. In the case of acute pain, it is recommended that tablets be taken at least 30 minutes before meals. Dexketoprofen is not recommended for children.",
        "contraindications": "Dexketoprofen tablets are not recommended to use in patients who are allergic to this product or aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines; who have suffered attacks of asthma, bronchospasm, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps, urticaria, angioedema (swollen face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in breathing) after taking aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines; who have or previously suffered from a peptic ulcer or chronic gastro-intestinal disorders; who had previously gastro-intestinal haemorrhage (bleeding); who have suffered bronchial asthma; who have severe heart failure, moderate to severe renal dysfunction or severely impaired hepatic function; who have a bleeding disorder, a blood clotting disorder or are taking an anticoagulant; and who are pregnant or breast-feeding.",
        "side_effects": "As with all medicines, Actidex 25 mg tablets may cause some unwanted effects in some patients. These are described below and are characteristic of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs: Common (1-10%): nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain or heartburn. Uncommon (0.1-1%): sleep disorders, nervousness, headache, dizziness, vertigo, palpitations, constipation, dry mouth, flatulence, skin rash, fatigue, hot flushes, shivering, general malaise. Rare (0.01 0.1%): stomach ulceration, gastric haemorrhage or perforation; pins and needles, high blood pressure, water retention, slowed breathing rate, hepatic enzymes increased, increased sweating. Very rare/isolated cases (<0.01%): blurred vision, ringing in the ear, low blood pressure, haematological reactions, hepatic or renal damage, dermatological and photosensitivity reactions, bronchospasm or anaphylaxis. In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or mixed connective tissue disease, antiinflammatory medicines may rarely cause isolated cases of fever, headache and rigidity of the nape (back of the neck).",

        "pharmacology": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Symptoms : Symptoms of Act overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Act overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Act concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Act. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

Read more Antioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows: β carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with β carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",
        "pharmacology": "Beta carotene of this tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity. Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption. vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.",

        "contraindications": "Carocet is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components.",
        "side_effects": "β carotene is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids. Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation. Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.",

        "indications": "Pioglitazone & Metformin combination is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are already treated with a combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin or whose diabetes is not adequately controlled with Metformin alone or for those patients who have initially responded to Pioglitazone and require additional glycemic control.",
        "pharmacology": "Pioglitazone depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. Pioglitazone decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulindependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone is a potent and highly selective agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARg). Activation of PPARg nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism. Metformin hydrochloride improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects and does not cause hyperinsulinemia.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "General : The use of antihyperglycemic therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes should be individualized on the basis of effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of Pioglitazone 45 mg and Metformin 2550 mg. Dosage Recommendations : Selecting the starting dose of Pioglitazone & Metformin should be based on the patient's current regimen of Pioglitazone and/or Metformin. Pioglitazone & Metformin should be given in divided daily doses with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with Metformin. Starting dose for patients inadequately controlled on Metformin monotherapy Based on the usual starting dose of Pioglitazone (15-30 mg daily), Pioglitazone & Metformin may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once or twice daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response. Starting dose for patients who initially responded to Pioglitazone monotherapy and require additional glycemic control Based on the usual starting doses of Metformin (500 mg twice daily or 850 mg daily), Pioglitazone & Metformin may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response. Starting dose for patients switching from combination therapy of Pioglitazone plus Metformin as separate tablets Pioglitazone & Metformin may be initiated with either the 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strengths based on the dose of Pioglitazone and Metformin already being taken. Maximum Recommended Dose : Pioglitazone & Metformin tablets are available as a 15 mg Pioglitazone plus 500 mg Metformin or a 15 mg Pioglitazone plus 850 mg Metformin formulation for oral administration. The maximum recommended dose for Pioglitazone is 45 mg daily. The maximum recommended daily dose for Metformin is 2550 mg in adults. Special Patient Populations: The initial and maintenance dosing of combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of Metformin associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly. Therapy with combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin should not be initiated if the patient exhibits clinical evidence of active liver disease or increased serumtransaminase levels (ALT greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) at start of therapy. Liver enzyme monitoring is recommended in all patients prior to initiation of therapy with combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin and periodically thereafter",

Known hypersensitivity to Pioglitazone, Metformin or any other component of this combination. Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis with or without coma.",
        "side_effects": "Generally this combined preparation is well tolerated. However, the most common side effects are upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, peripheral edema and headache, respectively. These are mild in severity.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Pregnancy: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with this combination or its individual components. So, it should only be used if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing mother: It is not known whether Pioglitazone and/or Metformin are secreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, this combination should not be administered to a breastfeeding woman.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Pioglitazone exerts its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of insulin. Therefore, Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Pioglitazone should be used with caution in combination especially with insulin, hepatic insufficiency and heart diseases. Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of Metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive ActoMeg.",

Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area. Symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity may include generalized skin rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal upset and angioneurotic oedema, difficulties in breathing, palpitation and reduction in blood pressure. Generalised hypersensitivity reactions are potentially life threatening. Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy. These symptoms are usually of transitory nature.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "There are no restrictions on the treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy as insulin does not pass the placental barrier.

Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement. Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (rapid acting insulin, dual acting insulin, intermediate and long acting insulin etc.), species (animal, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may result in the need for a change in dosage. Before travelling between different time zones, the patients should be advised to consult the doctor, since this may mean that the patients have to take insulin and meals at different time.",

Maximum single dose is 8 mg tablet. Salbutamol Respirator Solution : To be used with a suitable nebulizer device under the direction of a physician. The solution must not be injected or ingested. Method-1 (Intermittent Administration): Adults (and the elderly): 0.5 ml-1.0 ml salbutamol up to four times a day. Up to 40mg per day can be given under strict medical direction in the hospital. 0.5-1 ml solution should be diluted to final volume of 2-4 ml with sterile normal saline solution. It will take time about 10 minutes. Salbutamol respiratory solution may be used undiluted for intermittent administration. For this 2.0 ml of the solution is placed in the nebulizer and the patient allowed to inhale until bronchodilation is achieved. This usually takes 3-5 minutes. Children under 12 years of age: 0.5 ml of the solution diluted to 2.0-4.0 ml with normal saline. Some children may however require higher doses of up to 1.0 ml of the solution. Intermittent treatment may be repeated four times a day. Method-2 (Continuous administration): 1-2 ml solution is diluted to make up to 100 ml with normal saline solution. The diluted solution is administered by a suitable nebulizer devise. When there is risk of anoxia through hypoventilation, oxygen should be added to the inspired air.

It should not be injected undiluted. A suitable solution for infusion may be prepared by diluting 5 mL of Salbutamol I.V. infusion solution (1000 mcg/mL) in 500 mL of a chosen i.v. solution to provide a salbutamol concentration of 10 mcg/mL. The only recommended diluents are Sodium Chloride Injection, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection. Infusion rates providing 3 to 20 micrograms salbutamol/minute (0.3 to 2ml/minute of the above infusion solution) are usually adequate. Infusion rates can be started at 5 mcg of salbutamol/min., and can be increased to 10 mcg/min., and 20 mcg/min. at 15 - 30 minute intervals, if necessary. As with all parenteral drug products, intravenous admixtures should be inspected visually for clarity, particulate matter, precipitate, discoloration and leakage prior to administration. All unused admixtures of Salbutamol infusion solution with infusion fluids should be discarded 24 hours after preparation. Children and Adolescents (<18 years of age): The dosage of Salbutamol infusion solution in the pediatric age group has not been established. At present, there are insufficient data to recommend a dosage regimen for children. Salbutamol Inhalation Capsule : Adults: For the relief of bronchospasm and for managing intermittent episodes of asthma, one or two inhalation capsule may be administered as a single dose. The usual recommended dosage of Salbutamol inhalation capsule for inhalation for adults for maintenance or prophylactic therapy is the contents of one 200 microgram capsule every 4 to 6 hours using a device. In some patients, the contents of two 200 microgram capsules inhaled every 4 to 6 hours may be required. Large doses or more frequent administration is not recommended. The use of salbutamol powder for inhalation can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring/intermittent episodes of bronchospasm. Children: One Salbutamol inhalation capsule is the recommended dose for relief of acute bronchospasm in the maintenance of episodic asthma or before exercise of children 4 years of age and older. One inhalation should be administered for three or four times a day for routine maintenance or prophylactic therapy. This dosage may be increased to inhalation of two inhalation capsule, if necessary. The bronchodilator effect of each administration of inhaled Salbutamol inhalation capsule lasts for at least four hours.

        "pharmacology": "Bisoprolol Fumarate is the most selective ß1 blocker. It displays highest level of affinity for the ß1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks ß1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by ß-blockers, in patients with non-ß1 selective ß1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy. The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties. Absorption and bioavailability : Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg. Metabolism : Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role. Elimination : The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Adult : In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit. Children : Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment : In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis. Geriatrics : In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction",

Metformin hydrochloride improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects and does not cause hyperinsulinemia.",

Dosage Recommendations : Selecting the starting dose of Pioglitazone & Metformin should be based on the patient's current regimen of Pioglitazone and/or Metformin. Pioglitazone & Metformin should be given in divided daily doses with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects associated with Metformin. Starting dose for patients inadequately controlled on Metformin monotherapy Based on the usual starting dose of Pioglitazone (15-30 mg daily), Pioglitazone & Metformin may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once or twice daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response. Starting dose for patients who initially responded to Pioglitazone monotherapy and require additional glycemic control Based on the usual starting doses of Metformin (500 mg twice daily or 850 mg daily), Pioglitazone & Metformin may be initiated at either the 15 mg/500 mg twice daily or 15 mg/850 mg tablet strength once daily, and gradually titrated after assessing adequacy of therapeutic response.

The maximum recommended dose for Pioglitazone is 45 mg daily. The maximum recommended daily dose for Metformin is 2550 mg in adults. Special Patient Populations: The initial and maintenance dosing of combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of Metformin associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly. Therapy with combination of Pioglitazone and Metformin should not be initiated if the patient exhibits clinical evidence of active liver disease or increased serumtransaminase levels (ALT greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal) at start of therapy.

Therefore, Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Pioglitazone should be used with caution in combination especially with insulin, hepatic insufficiency and heart diseases. Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of Metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive ActoMeg.",

Angina pectoris : Acudipin is indicated for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris and is efficacious as monotherapy. It may be used in combination with other antianginal agents. Vasospastic angina : Acudipin is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal drugs.",
        "pharmacology": "Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, with a long duration of action, used for the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. Amlodipine influences the myocardial cells, the cells within the specialized conducting system of the heart, and the cells of vascular smooth muscle. Administration of Amlodipine results primarily in vasodilation, with reduced peripheral resistance, blood pressure and afterload, increased coronary blood flow and a reflex increase in coronary heart rate. This in turn results in an increase in myocardial oxygen supply and cardiac output.",

Elderly patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily; this dose may also be used when adding Amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy. Angina (Chronic stable or Vasospastic) : 5 to 10 mg, using the lower dose for elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients require 10 mg. Administrations: May be taken without regard to meals.",

Gastrointestinal disturbances, increased micturition frequency, lethargy, eye pain and mental depression may also occur. A paradoxical increase in ischaemic chest pain may occur at the start of the treatment and in a few patients excessive fall in blood pressure has led to cerebral or myocardial ischaemia or transient blindness. Rashes, fever and abnormalities in liver function due to hypersensitivity reaction of Acudipin may occur.",

In the absence of this information, it is recommended that nursing be discontinued while Amlodipine is administered.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Precaution should be taken in patients with hepatic impairment and during pregnancy and breast feeding.",
        "overdose_effects": "Symptoms : Available data suggest that large overdosage could result in excessive peripheral vasodilatation and possibly reflex tachycardia. Marked and probably prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported. Management : Clinically significant hypotension due to amlodipine overdosage calls for active cardiovascular support including frequent monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade. Gastric lavage may be worthwhile in some cases. In healthy volunteers the use of charcoal up to 2 hours after administration of amlodipine 10 mg has been shown to reduce the absorption rate of amlodipine. Since amlodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit."

        "indications": "Acubis tablet is indicated in- Hypertension Angina Moderate to severe heart failure Acubis is not recommended for the emergency treatment of hypertensive crises.",
        "pharmacology": "Bisoprolol Fumarate is the most selective ß1 blocker. It displays highest level of affinity for the ß1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks ß1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by ß-blockers, in patients with non-ß1 selective ß1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy. The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties. Absorption and bioavailability : Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg. Metabolism : Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role. Elimination : The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Adult : In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit. Children : Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment : In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis. Geriatrics : In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction",

Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Lactation : Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.

Use in breastfeeding mothers : Thiazides appear in breast milk. If use of the drug is deemed essential, the patient should stop breast-feeding.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Patients should be carefully monitored for signs of fluid and electrolyte imbalance (hyponatraemia, hypochloraemic alkalosis, hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia). It is particularly important to make serum and urine electrolyte determinations when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include: dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, seizures, confusion, muscle pains or cramps, muscle fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastro-intestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalaemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy. Hypokalaemia can sensitise or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g. increased ventricular irritability). Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with or without history of allergy or bronchial asthma. Hypokalaemia may be avoided or treated in the adult by concurrent use of amiloride hydrochloride, a potassium conserving agent. It may also be avoided by giving potassium chloride or foods with a high potassium content. Diuretic-induced hyponatraemia is usually mild and asymptomatic. Dilutional hyponatraemia may occur in oedematous patients in hot weather; and, except in rare instances when hyponatraemia is life-threatening, appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt. Thiazides may decrease serum protein bound iodine levels without signs of thyroid disturbances. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion, and may also cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. When creatinine clearance falls below 30ml/min, thiazide diuretics become ineffective. Uraemia may be precipitated or increased by chlorothiazide. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. If increasing uraemia and oliguria occur during treatment of renal disease, Acuren should be discontinued. Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. Hyperuricaemia may occur, or gout may be precipitated, in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Thaizide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy. The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported. Latent diabetes may become manifest during thiazide administration.",
        "overdose_effects": "The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, hypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalaemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. In the event of overdosage, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed. If ingestion is recent, emesis should be induced or gastric lavage performed. Dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hepatic coma and hypotension should be corrected by established methods. If required, give oxygen or artificial respiration for respiratory impairment."

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Symptoms : Symptoms of Actol overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Actol overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Actol concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Actol. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

        "unit_price": "৳ 22.00",
        "indications": "Adarbi is indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily stroke and myocardial infarction. Adarbi may be used either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.",
        "pharmacology": "Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE, kinase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with efects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Azilsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosteronesecreting efects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathway for angiotensin II synthesis. An AT2 receptor is also found in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Azilsartan has more than a 10,000-fold greater afnity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction catalyzed by ACE. Because azilsartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase II), it should not afect bradykinin levels. Whether this diference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Azilsartan does not bind to or block other receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the efect of azilsartan on blood pressure. Azilsartan inhibits the pressor efects of an angiotensin II infusion in a dose-related manner. An azilsartan single dose equivalent to 32 mg azilsartan medoxomil inhibited the maximal pressor efect by approximately 90% at peak, and approximately 60% at 24 hours. Plasma angiotensin I and II concentrations and plasma renin activity increased while plasma aldosterone concentrations decreased after single and repeated administration of Azilsartan to healthy subjects; no clinically signifcant efects on serum potassium or sodium were observed. Absorption : Azilsartan medoxomil is hydrolyzed to azilsartan, the active metabolite, in the gastrointestinal tract during absorption. Azilsartan medoxomil is not detected in plasma after oral administration. Dose proportionality in exposure was established for azilsartan in the azilsartan medoxomil dose range of 20 mg to 320 mg after single or multiple dosing. The estimated absolute bioavailability of azilsartan following administration of azilsartan medoxomil is approximately 60%. After oral administration of azilsartan medoxomil, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of azilsartan are reached within 1.5 to 3 hours. Food does not afect the bioavailability of azilsartan. Distribution : The volume of distribution of azilsartan is approximately 16L. Azilsartan is highly bound to human plasma proteins (>99%), mainly serum albumin. Protein binding is constant at azilsartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, minimal azilsartan-associated radioactivity crossed the blood-brain barrier. Azilsartan passed across the placental barrier in pregnant rats and was distributed to the fetus. Metabolism and Elimination : Azilsartan is metabolized to two primary metabolites. The major metabolite in plasma is formed by O-dealkylation, referred to as metabolite M-II, and the minor metabolite is formed by decarboxylation, referred to as metabolite M-I. Systemic exposures to the major and minor metabolites in humans were approximately 50% and less than 1% of azilsartan, respectively. M-I and M-II do not contribute to the pharmacologic activity of Azilsartan. The major enzyme responsible for azilsartan metabolism is CYP2C9.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "The recommended dose in adults is 80 mg taken orally once daily. Consider a Starting dose of 40 mg for patients who are treated with high doses of diuretics. If blood pressure is not controlled with Azilsartan alone, additional blood pressure reduction can be achieved by taking Azilsartan with other antihypertensive agents.",

It is not known whether Azilsartan Medoxomil is excreted in human milk, as many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Use of Adarbi during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g., those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Changes in renal function including renal failure has been reported in renal impaired patient.",

        "indications": "Adarbi is indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily stroke and myocardial infarction. Adarbi may be used either alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.",
        "pharmacology": "Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE, kinase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with efects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Azilsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosteronesecreting efects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathway for angiotensin II synthesis. An AT2 receptor is also found in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Azilsartan has more than a 10,000-fold greater afnity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction catalyzed by ACE. Because azilsartan does not inhibit ACE (kinase II), it should not afect bradykinin levels. Whether this diference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Azilsartan does not bind to or block other receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the efect of azilsartan on blood pressure. Azilsartan inhibits the pressor efects of an angiotensin II infusion in a dose-related manner. An azilsartan single dose equivalent to 32 mg azilsartan medoxomil inhibited the maximal pressor efect by approximately 90% at peak, and approximately 60% at 24 hours. Plasma angiotensin I and II concentrations and plasma renin activity increased while plasma aldosterone concentrations decreased after single and repeated administration of Azilsartan to healthy subjects; no clinically signifcant efects on serum potassium or sodium were observed. Absorption : Azilsartan medoxomil is hydrolyzed to azilsartan, the active metabolite, in the gastrointestinal tract during absorption. Azilsartan medoxomil is not detected in plasma after oral administration. Dose proportionality in exposure was established for azilsartan in the azilsartan medoxomil dose range of 20 mg to 320 mg after single or multiple dosing. The estimated absolute bioavailability of azilsartan following administration of azilsartan medoxomil is approximately 60%. After oral administration of azilsartan medoxomil, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of azilsartan are reached within 1.5 to 3 hours. Food does not afect the bioavailability of azilsartan. Distribution : The volume of distribution of azilsartan is approximately 16L. Azilsartan is highly bound to human plasma proteins (>99%), mainly serum albumin. Protein binding is constant at azilsartan plasma concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. In rats, minimal azilsartan-associated radioactivity crossed the blood-brain barrier. Azilsartan passed across the placental barrier in pregnant rats and was distributed to the fetus. Metabolism and Elimination : Azilsartan is metabolized to two primary metabolites. The major metabolite in plasma is formed by O-dealkylation, referred to as metabolite M-II, and the minor metabolite is formed by decarboxylation, referred to as metabolite M-I. Systemic exposures to the major and minor metabolites in humans were approximately 50% and less than 1% of azilsartan, respectively. M-I and M-II do not contribute to the pharmacologic activity of Azilsartan. The major enzyme responsible for azilsartan metabolism is CYP2C9.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "The recommended dose in adults is 80 mg taken orally once daily. Consider a Starting dose of 40 mg for patients who are treated with high doses of diuretics. If blood pressure is not controlled with Azilsartan alone, additional blood pressure reduction can be achieved by taking Azilsartan with other antihypertensive agents.",

Zinc sulfate can also be used orally or systemically as a zinc supplement. 220 mg of zinc sulfate (heptahydrate) contains 50 mg of elemental zinc. Iron is an essential mineral, with several important roles in the body. For example, it helps to make red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body. A lack of iron can lead to iron deficiency anaemia. Liver is a good source of iron, don't eat it if you are pregnant. This is because it is also rich in vitamin A which, in large amounts, can harm your unborn baby. Folic acid is essential for the production of certain coenzymes in many metabolic systems such as purine and pyrimidine synthesis. It is also essential in the synthesis and maintenance of nucleoprotein in erythropoesis. It also promotes WBC and platelet production in folate-deficiency anaemia. Nicotinamide is a vitamin B3 derivative. It is incorporated into coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are involved in multiple cellular metabolic pathways. Vitamin C is necessary for collagen formation and tissue repair; plays a role in oxidation/reduction reactions as well as other metabolic pathways including synthesis of catecholamines, carnitine, and steroids; also plays a role in conversion of folic acid to folinic acid. Vitamin B complex : The building blocks for good health come from a variety of foods, even if they are from the same family of nutrients. Such is the case with vitamin B, a key player in maintaining cell health and keeping you energized. Not all types of vitamin B do the same thing. Additionally, the different types of vitamin B all come from different types of foods. Vitamin B deficiencies can lead to health problems.

Riboflavin is reported to be completely safe and no toxic symptoms have been reported so far. Higher doses of Nicotinamide may cause vomiting, diarrhea. Sensory neuropathy was observed in individuals consuming more than 200 mg Pyridoxine for very long periods. No case of Folic acid overdodage has been reported. Acute ingestion of Ascorbic acid , even of massive doses, is unlikely to cause significant effects. Zinc toxicity has been seen in both acute and chronic forms. Ingestion of 150 to 450 mg of zinc per day have been associated with low copper status, altered iron function, reduced immune function, and reduced levels of high-density lipoproteins.

        "unit_price": "৳ 50.15",
        "indications": "Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Adegra to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Adegra is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.",
        "pharmacology": "Mechanism of Action : The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours. Absorption and Distribution : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced. Metabolism and Excretion : Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose). Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations : Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Erectile dysfunction : For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day. The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil : age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose. Pulmonary arterial hypertension : The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.",
        "contraindications": "Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.",

Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of Adegra without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of Adegra and sexual activity.

        "precautions_and_warnings": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Adegra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Adegra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs. Adegra has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications. Patients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Adegra. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Adegra, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted. The safety of Adegra is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration. Adegra should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). The safety and efficacy of combinations of Adegra with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended. There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Adegra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Adegra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Adegra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Adegra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Adegra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months; Patients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110); Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina; Patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases); Patients with sickle cell or related anemias. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Adegra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Adegra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Adegra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Adegra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Adegra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Adegra dosage is recommended.",
        "overdose_effects": "In studies with healthy volunteers of single doses up to 800 mg, adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses but incidence rates and severities were increased. 24 In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as Adegra is highly bound to plasma proteins and it is not eliminated in the urine."

        "indications": "Adegut is indicated in- Dyspeptic symptom complex , often associated with delayed gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis: Epigastric sense of fullness, feeling of abdominal distension, upper abdominal pain Eructation, flatulence, early satiety Nausea and vomiting Heartburn with or without regurgitations of gastric contents in the mouth Non-ulcer dyspepsia Acute nausea and vomiting of the functional, organic, infectious, dietetic origin or induced by radiotherapy or drug therapy or induced in migraine. Parkinson's disease : In dopamine-agonist induced nausea and vomiting. Radiological studies : Speeding barium transit in follow-through radiological studies.",
        "pharmacology": "Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist that principally blocks the dopamine receptors located in the ChemoreceptorTrigger Zone (CTZ) and stomach. Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Domperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring. The usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows: Adults : 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily. Children : 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. In dyspeptic symptom: Adults : 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. Children : 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. In acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting): Adults : 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily Children : 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks). By rectum in suppositories: Adults (including elderly) : 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours. Children : The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary. The maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.",
        "contraindications": "Domperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).",
        "side_effects": "Side-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Domperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Adegut should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.",
        "overdose_effects": "Symptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions."

It is thought that the increased levels of intracellular cyclic AMP are responsible for the therapeutic actions of Roflumilast.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Adult dose : The recommended dose is one tablet of 500 micrograms Roflumilast once daily. Roflumilast may need to be taken for several weeks to achieve its effect. Roflumilast has been studied in clinical trials for up to one year. Elderly (65 years and older) : No dose adjustment is necessary. Renal impairment : No dose adjustment is necessary. Hepatic impairment: The clinical data with Roflumilast in patients with mild hepatic impairment classified as Child-Pugh A are insufficient to recommend a dose adjustment and therefore Roflumilast should be used with caution in these patients. Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment classified as Child-Pugh B or C must not take Roflumilast. Pediatric population : There is no relevant use of Roflumilast in the paediatric population (under 18 years). The tablet should be swallowed with water and taken at the same time every day. The tablet can be taken with or without food.",

Roflumilast should not be used during breastfeeding.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "All patients should be informed about the risks of Adair and the precautions for safe use. Rescue medicinal products : Adair is an anti-inflammatory substance; it is not indicated as rescue medicinal product for the relief of acute bronchospasms. Weight decrease : In 1-year studies, a decrease of body weight occurred more frequently in patients treated with Adair compared to placebo-treated patients. After discontinuation of Adair, the majority of patients had regained body weight after 3 months. Body weight of underweight patients should be checked at each visit. Patients should be advised to check their body weight on a regular basis. In the event of an unexplained and clinically concerning weight decrease, the intake of Adair should be stopped and body weight should be further followed-up. Special clinical conditions: Due to lack of relevant experience, treatment with Adair should not be initiated or existing treatment with Adair should be stopped in patients with severe immunological diseases (e.g. HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), severe acute infectious diseases, cancers (except basal cell carcinoma), or patients being treated with immunosuppressive medicinal products (i.e.: methotrexate, azathioprine, infliximab, etanercept, or oral corticosteroids to be taken long-term; except short-term systemic corticosteroids). Experience in patients with latent infections such as tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, herpes viral infection and herpes zoster is limited. Patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA grades 3 and 4) have not been studied and therefore treatment of these patients is not recommended. Psychiatric disorders: Adair is associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders such as insomnia, anxiety, nervousness and depression. Rare instances of suicidal ideation and behaviour, including completed suicide, have been observed in patients with or without history of depression, usually within the first weeks of treatment. The risks and benefits of starting or continuing treatment with Adair should be carefully assessed if patients report previous or existing psychiatric symptoms or if concomitant treatment with other medicinal products likely to cause psychiatric events is intended. Adair is not recommended in patients with a history of depression associated with suicidal ideation or behaviour. Patients and caregivers should be instructed to notify the prescriber of any changes in behaviour or mood and of any suicidal ideation. If patients suffered from new or worsening psychiatric symptoms, or suicidal ideation or suicidal attempt is identified, it is recommended to discontinue treatment with Adair. Persistent intolerability : While adverse reactions like diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain and headache mainly occur within the first weeks of therapy and mostly resolve on continued treatment, Adair treatment should be reassessed in case of persistent intolerability. This might be the case in special populations that may have higher exposure, such as in black, nonsmoking females or in patients concomitantly treated with the CYP1A2 inhibitor such as fluvoxamine or the dual CYP3A4/1A2 inhibitors such as enoxacin and cimetidine. Theophylline : There are no clinical data to support the concomitant treatment with theophylline for maintenance therapy. Therefore, the concomitant treatment with theophylline is not recommended. Lactose : Adair tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.",
        "overdose_effects": "In Phase I studies, the following symptoms were observed at an increased rate after single oral doses of 2,500 micrograms and one single dose of 5,000 micrograms (ten times the recommended dose): headache, gastrointestinal disorders, dizziness, palpitations, light-headedness, clamminess and arterial hypotension. In case of overdose, it is recommended that the appropriate supportive medical care is provided. Since Adair is highly protein bound, haemodialysis is not likely to be an efficient method of its removal. It is not known whether Adair is dialysable by peritoneal dialysis."

Read more Adecin is indicated for the treatment of single infection or mixed infections caused by two or more susceptible organisms. It can also be used for infections caused by organisms resistant to other antibiotics including Aminoglycosides, Penicillins and Cephalosporins. As antibacterial concentrations of Adecin are obtained in serum and body tissues as well as in the urine following administration by mouth, Adecin has been suggested for use in the treatment of a wide range of infections caused by susceptible organisms including infections of the urinary, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, gonorrhoea and septicaemia. The extensive tissue penetration of Adecin combined with its enhanced antibacterial activity (including antipseudomonal activity), enables Adecin to be used alone (pending sensitivity results) or in combination with an Aminoglycoside or with beta lactam antibiotics for instance when severe neutropenia is present or with an antibiotic active against anaerobes where the presence of bacteroides fragilis is suspected. Adecin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections caused by sensitive bacteria: Severe systemic infections: e.g. septicaemia, bacteraemia, peritionitis, infections in immunosuppressed patients with haematological or solid tumors and in patients in intensive care unit with specific problems such as infected burns.

These hazards include fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions, which have occurred in the adult. The routine use of diuretics in otherwise healthy pregnant women with or without mild oedema is not recommended, because their use may be associated with hypovolaemia, increased blood viscosity and decreased placental perfusion. Use in breastfeeding mothers : Thiazides appear in breast milk. If use of the drug is deemed essential, the patient should stop breast-feeding.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Patients should be carefully monitored for signs of fluid and electrolyte imbalance (hyponatraemia, hypochloraemic alkalosis, hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia). It is particularly important to make serum and urine electrolyte determinations when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance include: dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, seizures, confusion, muscle pains or cramps, muscle fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastro-intestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalaemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis, when severe cirrhosis is present, or after prolonged therapy. Hypokalaemia can sensitise or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g. increased ventricular irritability). Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with or without history of allergy or bronchial asthma. Hypokalaemia may be avoided or treated in the adult by concurrent use of amiloride hydrochloride, a potassium conserving agent. It may also be avoided by giving potassium chloride or foods with a high potassium content. Diuretic-induced hyponatraemia is usually mild and asymptomatic. Dilutional hyponatraemia may occur in oedematous patients in hot weather; and, except in rare instances when hyponatraemia is life-threatening, appropriate therapy is water restriction rather than administration of salt. Thiazides may decrease serum protein bound iodine levels without signs of thyroid disturbances. Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion, and may also cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. When creatinine clearance falls below 30ml/min, thiazide diuretics become ineffective. Uraemia may be precipitated or increased by chlorothiazide. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. If increasing uraemia and oliguria occur during treatment of renal disease, Acuren should be discontinued. Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma. Hyperuricaemia may occur, or gout may be precipitated, in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Thaizide therapy may impair glucose tolerance. Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy. The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported. Latent diabetes may become manifest during thiazide administration.",
        "overdose_effects": "The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalaemia, hypochloraemia, hyponatraemia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalaemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. In the event of overdosage, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed. If ingestion is recent, emesis should be induced or gastric lavage performed. Dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hepatic coma and hypotension should be corrected by established methods. If required, give oxygen or artificial respiration for respiratory impairment."

NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours. Absorption and Distribution : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced. Metabolism and Excretion : Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose). Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations : Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Erectile dysfunction : For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day. The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil : age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose. Pulmonary arterial hypertension : The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.",
        "contraindications": "Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.",

Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of Adegra without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of Adegra and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to Adegra, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying 23 cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors. Nervous : seizure, seizure recurrence, anxiety, and transient global amnesia. Urogenital : prolonged erection, priapism and hematuria. Special Senses : diplopia, temporary vision loss/decreased vision, ocular redness or bloodshot appearance, ocular burning, ocular swelling/pressure, increased intraocular pressure, retinal vascular disease or bleeding, vitreous detachment/traction, paramacular edema and epistaxis.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Pregnancy category B. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Sildenafil in pregnant women. Sildenafil is not indicated for use by women. In animal study shows that Sildenafil has no evidence of teratogenicity or embryotoxicity.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Adegra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Adegra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs. Adegra has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications. Patients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Adegra. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Adegra, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted. The safety of Adegra is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration. Adegra should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). The safety and efficacy of combinations of Adegra with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended. There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Adegra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Adegra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Adegra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Adegra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Adegra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months; Patients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110); Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina; Patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases); Patients with sickle cell or related anemias. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Adegra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Adegra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Adegra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Adegra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Adegra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Adegra dosage is recommended.",
        "overdose_effects": "In studies with healthy volunteers of single doses up to 800 mg, adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses but incidence rates and severities were increased. 24 In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as Adegra is highly bound to plasma proteins and it is not eliminated in the urine."

        "pharmacology": "Angiotensin II formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT 1 receptor found in many tissues, (e.g. vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT 1 receptor. Neither Losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kinase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin); nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of Sodium and Chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in Aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary Potassium loss, and decreases in serum Potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the Potassium loss associated with these diuretics.",

        "indications": "Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Adegra to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Adegra is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.",
        "pharmacology": "Mechanism of Action : The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours. Absorption and Distribution : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced. Metabolism and Excretion : Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose). Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations : Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Erectile dysfunction : For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day. The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil : age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose.

        "precautions_and_warnings": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Adegra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Adegra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs. Adegra has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications. Patients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Adegra. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Adegra, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted. The safety of Adegra is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration. Adegra should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). The safety and efficacy of combinations of Adegra with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended. There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Adegra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Adegra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Adegra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Adegra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Adegra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months; Patients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110); Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina; Patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases); Patients with sickle cell or related anemias. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Adegra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Adegra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Adegra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Adegra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Adegra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Adegra dosage is recommended.",
        "overdose_effects": "In studies with healthy volunteers of single doses up to 800 mg, adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses but incidence rates and severities were increased. 24 In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as Adegra is highly bound to plasma proteins and it is not eliminated in the urine."

        "pharmacology": "Linagliptin inhibits DPP-4 enzyme which declines the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the levels of glucagon. Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretin hormones are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore, GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output. Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2). SGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from kidney back into the circulation. By inhibiting SGLT2, Empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.",

It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years : The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly : Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children : The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid : the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years : Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months : The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months. Dosage in Renal Impairment : Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",

Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with Adexim, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. Adexim should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Adexim should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",

        "pharmacology": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections: Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms : Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms : Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae Other microorganisms : Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity.

Treatment with Adiponil should be discontinued after 12 weeks in patients who have not lost at least 5% of their body weight as measured at the start of drug therapy. Adolescents (12 years & older) : Obese adolescents should be treated with Adiponil only if an adequate reduction of body weight cannot be achieved by means of diet & increased physical activity. Treatment with Adiponil should be considered in particular if complications of obesity are present.",
        "pharmacology": "Orlistat is a potent, specific and long-acting lipase inhibitor. It exerts its therapeutic activity in the lumen of the stomach and upper small intestine by forming a covalent bond with the active serine site of gastric and pancreatic lipases. The inactivated enzyme is thus rendered unable to hydrolyze dietary fats in the form of triglycerides into absorbable free fatty acids and monoglycerides. As undigested triglycerides can not be absorbed, a caloric deficit arises which has a positive effect on weight control. Systemic absorption of orlistat is therefore not needed for the activity. At the recommended therapeutic dose of 120 mg three times a day, orlistat inhibit dietary fat absorption by approximately 30%.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "The recommended dose of Orlistat is one 120 mg capsule to be taken immediately before, during or up to one hour after each main meal. If a meal is missed or contains no fat the dose of Orlistat should be omitted. Doses of Orlistat above 120 mg three times daily have not been shown to provide additional benefits. The effect of Orlistat results in an increase in fecal fat 24-48 hours after dosing. Upon discontinuation of therapy, fecal fat content usually returns to pretreatment levels within 48-72 hours. The safety & efficacy of Orlistat were investigated in clinical studies lasting up to 4 years. The recommended dose of Orlistat for adolescents is as same as adults. Special dosage instruction : The tolerability and efficacy of Orlistat have not been studied in elderly patients, or patients with hepatic and/ or renal impairments.",
        "contraindications": "Orlistat is contraindicated in patients with chronic malabsorption syndrome, in patients with cholestasis and in patients who are hypersensitive to orlistat or to any of the other ingredients of the capsules.",
        "side_effects": "Common : Undesirable effects of Adiponil are largely gastrointestinal in nature. Common gastrointestinal side effects are oily spotting from the rectum, flatulence, fecal urgency, oily or fatty stool, abdominal discomfort etc. Rare : Influenza, anxiety. headache, fatigue etc may rarely occur in some patients. Rare cases of hypersensitivity have been reported. Main clinical symptoms are pruritus, exanthema, urticaria, angioedema and anaphylaxis.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Pregnancy : Orlistat is Pregnancy Category X drug. Orlistat is contraindicated during pregnancy, because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm. A minimum weight gain, and no weight loss, is currently recommended for all pregnant women, including those who are already overweight or obese, due to the obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard of maternal weight loss to the fetus. Lactation : It is not known if Orlistat is present in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Orlistat is administered to a nursing woman.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Organic causes of obesity (e.g. hypothyroidism) should be excluded before prescribing Adiponil. Adiponil and cyclosporine should not be coadministered. Cyclosporine should be taken at least 2 hours before or after Adiponil in patients taking both drugs. Cyclosporine level should be measured and frequently monitored. In clinical trial, the decrease in body weight with Adiponil therapy was less in type II diabetic patients than in non-diabetic patients. Antidiabetic drug treatment should be closely monitored during Adiponil therapy. Because of the improvement in glycemic control, the dose of oral antidiabetics or of insulin may need to be adjusted. Patients should be advised to adhere to the dietary recommendations. The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects may increase when Adiponil is taken with a fatty meal. The daily intake of fat should be distributed between three main meals. Patients should be strongly encouraged to take a multivitamin supplement that contains fat soluble vitamins to ensure adequate nutrition because Adiponil has been shown to reduce the absorption of some fat soluble vitamins & beta-carotene. In addition, the levels of vitamin D & beta carotene may be low in obese patients compared with non-obese patients.",
        "overdose_effects": "Single doses of 800 mg Adiponil and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day for 15 days have been studied in normal-weight and obese subjects without significant adverse findings. Should a significant overdose of Adiponil occur, it is recommended that the patient be observed for 24 hours. Based on human and animal studies, systemic effects attributable to the lipase-inhibiting properties of Adiponil should be rapidly reversible."

        "pharmacology": "The H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.",

Linagliptin is an inhibitor of DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4), an enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). Thus, Linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta (β) cells in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the secretion of glucagon from pancreatic alpha (α) cells in the circulation. Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its mechanism of action is different from those of sulfonylureas and it does not produce hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Linagliptin & Metformin immediate release tablet : The dosage of Linagliptin & Metformin should be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerability. Maximum recommended dose of 2.5 mg Linagliptin and 1000 mg Metformin Hydrochloride twice daily with meals. Dose escalation should be gradual to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects associated with Metformin Hydrochloride use. Recommended starting dose: In patients currently not treated with Metformin Hydrochloride, initiate treatment with 2.5 mg Linagliptin and 500 mg Metformin Hydrochloride twice daily. In patients already treated with Metformin Hydrochloride, start with 2.5 mg Linagliptin and the current dose of Metformin Hydrochloride twice daily. Patients already treated with Linagliptin and Metformin Hydrochloride, individual components may be switched to this combination containing the same doses of each component. Linagliptin & Metformin extend release tablet : The dosage of this combination should be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerability, while not exceeding the maximum recommended total daily dose of Linagliptin 5 mg and Metformin Hydrochloride 2000 mg. this combination should be given once daily with a meal. Recommended starting dose: In patients currently not treated with metformin, initiate this combination treatment with 5 mg Linagliptin/1000 mg Metformin Hydrochloride extended-release once daily with a meal. In patients already treated with Metformin, start this combination with 5 mg of Linagliptin total daily dose and a similar total daily dose of Metformin once daily with a meal. In patients already treated with Linagliptin & Metformin immediate release tablet, switch to extend release tablet containing 5 mg of Linagliptin total daily dose and a similar total daily dose of Metformin once daily with a meal. 5 mg Linagliptin & 1000 mg Metformin Hydrochloride extended-release tablet should be taken as a single tablet once daily. Patients using 2.5 mg Linagliptin & 1000 mg Metformin extended release tablets should take two tablets together once daily.",
        "contraindications": "Although Linagliptin undergoes minimal renal excretion, Metformin Hydrochloride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. The risk of Metformin Hydrochloride accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Therefore, this combination is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment. It is also contraindicated in acute or chronic metabolic acidosis (diabetic ketoacidosis) and in hypersensitivity to Linagliptin or Metformin Hydrochloride.",

Temporarily discontinue Linagliptin & Metformin in patients undergoing radiologic studies with intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials or any surgical procedures necessitating restricted intake of food and fluids. Metformin may lower Vitamin B12 levels; so hematologic parameters shoud be monitored annually. Under certain conditions, too much metformin can cause lactic acidosis. The symptoms of lactic acidosis are severe and quick to appear, and usually occur when other health problems not related to the medicine are present and are very severe, such as a heart attack or kidney failure. Symptoms of lactic acidosis include: abdominal or stomach discomfort, decreased appetite, diarrhea, fast or shallow breathing, a general feeling of discomfort, muscle pain or cramping, and unusual sleepiness, tiredness, or weakness. Be sure to drink extra fluids when you exercise or increase your activity or if you have vomiting or diarrhea. Pancreatitis may occur while you are using this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have a sudden and severe stomach pain, chills, constipation, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, a fever, or lightheadedness. Need to temporarily stop taking this medicine before you have major surgery or diagnostic tests including procedures that use contrast dye. It is very important to carefully follow any instructions from your health care team about: Alcohol : Drinking alcohol may cause severe low blood sugar. Other medicines : This especially includes nonprescription medicines such as aspirin, and medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems. Counseling : Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Travel : Keep a recent prescription and your medical history with you. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times. In case of emergency : There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says you have diabetes and that lists all of your medicines. Linagliptin and metformin combination can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). However, this can also occur if you delay or miss a meal or snack, drink alcohol, exercise more than usual, cannot eat because of nausea or vomiting, take certain medicines, or take linagliptin and metformin combination with another type of diabetes medicine. The symptoms of low blood sugar must be treated before they lead to unconsciousness (passing out). Different people feel different symptoms of low blood sugar. It is important that you learn which symptoms of low blood sugar you usually have so you can treat it quickly.",
        "overdose_effects": "In the event of an overdose with Adlinameg the usual supportive measures (i.e. remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, perform clinical monitoring, and institute supportive treatment) should be employed. Removal of Linagliptin by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is unlikely but Metformin Hydrochloride is dialyzable. During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, with single doses of up to 600 mg of Linagliptin (equivalent to 120 times the recommended daily dose), there were no dose-related clinical adverse drug reactions. Overdose of Metformin Hydrochloride has occurred in case of ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with Metformin Hydrochloride has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of Metformin Hydrochloride overdose cases."

Flucloxacillin acts by inhibiting the formation of cell wall of bacteria. Flucloxacillin is isoxazolyl penicillin which combined the properties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, gastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive bacteria. Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Flucloxacillin kills bacterial cellwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. Peptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides the cell wall with its mechanical stability. The final stage of peptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the cross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the pentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the pentapeptide (D-alanine). The transpeptidase enzyme that performs this step is inhibited by Flucloxacillin. As a result the bacterial cellwall is weakened, the cell swells and then ruptures.

        "pharmacology": "Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter 2 (SGLT2). SGLT2 is the predominant transporter, responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the kidney back into the circulation. By inhibiting SGLT2, Empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion. Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug, used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. It does not produce hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "The dosage should be individualized based on effectiveness and tolerability. Take this combination twice daily with meals. Dose escalation should be gradual to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects due to Metformin Hydrochloride. Maximum recommended daily dose of Metformin Hydrochloride is 2000 mg and Empagliflozin is 25 mg. Recommended individualized starting dose : In patients on Metformin Hydrochloride, switch to this combination containing Empagliflozin 5 mg with a similar total daily dose of Metformin Hydrochloride. In patients on Empagliflozin, switch to this combination containing Metformin Hydrochloride 500 mg with a similar total daily dose of Empagliflozin. In patients already treated with Empagliflozin and Metformin Hydrochloride separately switch to this combination containing the same total daily doses of each component. In patients with volume depletion not previously treated with Empagliflozin, correct this condition before initiating this combination. Extended-release formulations : Individualize starting dose based on the patient’s current drug regimen. Take film coated tablet twice daily with meal and extended-release formulations should be taken once daily with meal, with gradual dose escalation to reduce the Gl adverse effects due to Metformin. Adjust dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of Metformin Hydrochloride 2000 mg and Empagliflozin 25 mg. Renal impaired patient : Assess renal function before initiating this combination. In patients with an eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 is contraindicated.

Temporarily discontinue Linagliptin & Metformin in patients undergoing radiologic studies with intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials or any surgical procedures necessitating restricted intake of food and fluids. Metformin may lower Vitamin B12 levels; so hematologic parameters shoud be monitored annually. Under certain conditions, too much metformin can cause lactic acidosis. The symptoms of lactic acidosis are severe and quick to appear, and usually occur when other health problems not related to the medicine are present and are very severe, such as a heart attack or kidney failure. Symptoms of lactic acidosis include: abdominal or stomach discomfort, decreased appetite, diarrhea, fast or shallow breathing, a general feeling of discomfort, muscle pain or cramping, and unusual sleepiness, tiredness, or weakness. Be sure to drink extra fluids when you exercise or increase your activity or if you have vomiting or diarrhea. Pancreatitis may occur while you are using this medicine. Check with your doctor right away if you have a sudden and severe stomach pain, chills, constipation, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, a fever, or lightheadedness. Need to temporarily stop taking this medicine before you have major surgery or diagnostic tests including procedures that use contrast dye. It is very important to carefully follow any instructions from your health care team about: Alcohol : Drinking alcohol may cause severe low blood sugar. Other medicines : This especially includes nonprescription medicines such as aspirin, and medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems. Counseling : Other family members need to learn how to prevent side effects or help with side effects if they occur. Travel : Keep a recent prescription and your medical history with you. Make allowances for changing time zones and keep your meal times as close as possible to your usual meal times. In case of emergency : There may be a time when you need emergency help for a problem caused by your diabetes. You need to be prepared for these emergencies. It is a good idea to wear a medical identification (ID) bracelet or neck chain at all times. Also, carry an ID card in your wallet or purse that says you have diabetes and that lists all of your medicines. Linagliptin and metformin combination can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). However, this can also occur if you delay or miss a meal or snack, drink alcohol, exercise more than usual, cannot eat because of nausea or vomiting, take certain medicines, or take linagliptin and metformin combination with another type of diabetes medicine. The symptoms of low blood sugar must be treated before they lead to unconsciousness (passing out). Different people feel different symptoms of low blood sugar. It is important that you learn which symptoms of low blood sugar you usually have so you can treat it quickly.",
        "overdose_effects": "In the event of an overdose with Adlinameg the usual supportive measures (i.e. remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, perform clinical monitoring, and institute supportive treatment) should be employed. Removal of Linagliptin by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is unlikely but Metformin Hydrochloride is dialyzable. During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, with single doses of up to 600 mg of Linagliptin (equivalent to 120 times the recommended daily dose), there were no dose-related clinical adverse drug reactions. Overdose of Metformin Hydrochloride has occurred in case of ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with Metformin Hydrochloride has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of Metformin Hydrochloride overdose cases."

        "unit_price": "৳ 28.00",
        "indications": "Adegut is indicated in- Dyspeptic symptom complex , often associated with delayed gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis: Epigastric sense of fullness, feeling of abdominal distension, upper abdominal pain Eructation, flatulence, early satiety Nausea and vomiting Heartburn with or without regurgitations of gastric contents in the mouth Non-ulcer dyspepsia Acute nausea and vomiting of the functional, organic, infectious, dietetic origin or induced by radiotherapy or drug therapy or induced in migraine. Parkinson's disease : In dopamine-agonist induced nausea and vomiting. Radiological studies : Speeding barium transit in follow-through radiological studies.",
        "pharmacology": "Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist that principally blocks the dopamine receptors located in the ChemoreceptorTrigger Zone (CTZ) and stomach. Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Domperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring. The usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows: Adults : 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily. Children : 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. In dyspeptic symptom: Adults : 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. Children : 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. In acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting): Adults : 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily Children : 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks). By rectum in suppositories: Adults (including elderly) : 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours. Children : The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary. The maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.",
        "contraindications": "Domperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).",
        "side_effects": "Side-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Domperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Adegut should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.",
        "overdose_effects": "Symptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions."

        "strength": "250 mg",
        "unit_price": "৳ 25.00",
        "indications": "Adiz is indicated for infections (caused by susceptible organisms) in lower respiratory tract infections including bronchitis and pneumonia, in upper respiratory tract infections including sinusitis and pharyngitis/tonsillitis, in otitis media, and in skin and soft tissue infections. In sexually transmitted diseases in men and women, Adiz is indicated in the treatment of non-gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis.",
        "pharmacology": "Azithromycin is acid-stable and can therefore be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed; its absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of azithromycin are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma. This is due to ion trapping and the high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single 500 mg dose, plasma concentrations of azithromycin declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL/min and a terminal elimination half life of 68 hours. The prolonged terminal half-life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, approximately 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine. Microbiology: Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and, thus, interfering with microbial protein synthesis. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections: Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms : Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms : Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae Other microorganisms : Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis , Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Betalactamase production should have no effect on azithromycin activity. Aerobic and facultative gram-positive microorganisms : Streptococci (Groups C,F,G), Viridans group streptococci Aerobic and facultative gram-negative microorganisms : Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila Anaerobic microorganisms : Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella bivia",

        "contraindications": "Azithromycin Dihydrate is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to Azithromycin or any other macrolide antibiotic. Co-administration of ergot derivatives and Azithromycin is contraindicated. Azithromycin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic diseases.",
        "side_effects": "Adiz is well tolerated with a low incidence of side-effects. Most side-effects observed were mild to moderate in severity. The majority of side-effects were gastrointestinal in origin with nauseas, abdominal discomfort (pain/cramps), vomiting, flatulence, diarrhoea and loose stools being occasionally observed. Allergic reactions such as rash or photosensitivity have occurred and there have also been rare reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions. Reversible elevations in liver transaminases have been seen with a frequency similar to the comparative macrolides and penicillins used in clinical trials. Rarely, cases of cholestatic jaundice have been observed. Transient mild reductions in neutrofil counts have occasionally been observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. Hearing impairment: In investigational studies where higher doses were used for prolonged periods of time, reversible hearing impairment was seen in some patients.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Pregnancy Category of Azithromycin Dihydrate is B. Animal reproduction studies have demonstrated that Azithromycin has no evidence of harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if adequate alternatives are not available. It is not known whether Azithromycin is secreted in breast milk. So, caution should be exercised when Azithromycin is administered to nursing women.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "As with erythromycin and other macrolides, rare serious allergic reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylaxis, has been reported. Some of these reactions with azithromycin have resulted in recurrent symptoms and required a long period of observation and treatment.",
        "overdose_effects": "There is no data on overdosage with Adiz. Typical symptoms of overdosage with macrolide antibiotics include hearing loss, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Gastric lavage and general supportive measures are indicated."

It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms. Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI) : e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis. Urinary Tract Infections : e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. Adexim is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
        "pharmacology": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years : The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly : Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children : The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid : the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years : Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months : The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months. Dosage in Renal Impairment : Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
        "contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
        "side_effects": "Adexim is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with Adexim are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Adexim should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with Adexim, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. Adexim should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Adexim should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
        "overdose_effects": "Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. Adexim is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of Adexim did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses."

        "pharmacology": "Bisoprolol Fumarate is the most selective ß1 blocker. It displays highest level of affinity for the ß1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks ß1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by ß-blockers, in patients with non-ß1 selective ß1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy. The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties. Absorption and bioavailability : Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg. Metabolism : Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role. Elimination : The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Adult : In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit. Children : Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment : In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis. Geriatrics : In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction",

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Symptoms : Symptoms of Adol overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Adol overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Adol concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Adol. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

Caution should be exercised when Doxepin is administered to nursing women.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Need to Evaluate for Comorbid Diagnoses : Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Exacerbation of insomnia or the emergence of new cognitive or behavioral abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with hypnotic drugs. Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Change s: Complex behaviors such as “sleep-driving” (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a hypnotic, with amnesia for the event) have been reported with hypnotics. These events can occur in hypnotic-naive as well as in hypnotic-experienced persons. Although behaviors such as \"sleep-driving\" may occur with hypnotics alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with hypnotics appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of hypnotics at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose. Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of Adnor should be strongly considered for patients who report a \"sleep-driving\" episode. Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a hypnotic. As with \"sleep-driving\", patients usually do not remember these events. Amnesia, anxiety and other neuro-psychiatric symptoms may occur unpredictably. Suicide Risk and Worsening of Depression : In primarily depressed patients, worsening of depression, including suicidal thoughts and actions (including completed suicides), has been reported in association with the use of hypnotics. Adnor, the active ingredient in Adnor, is an antidepressant at doses 10- to 100-fold higher than in Adnor. Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Risk from the lower dose of Adnor in Adnor can not be excluded. It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.",

        "pharmacology": "Bisoprolol Fumarate is the most selective ß1 blocker. It displays highest level of affinity for the ß1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks ß1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by ß-blockers, in patients with non-ß1 selective ß1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy. The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties. Absorption and bioavailability : Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg. Metabolism : Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role. Elimination : The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Adult : In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit. Children : Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment : In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis. Geriatrics : In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction",

        "side_effects": "Side-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped.

However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Adorex should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier.

        "pharmacology": "Propranolol Hydrochloride is a B-adrenergic receptor blocking drug which is widely used in hypertension and angina pectoris. Propranolol antagonizes catecholamines at B-adrenergic receptors, thus prevents excess rate and force of contraction of the heart and decreases the excess consumption of oxygen by the heart. Propranolol is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but a portion is immediately metabolized by the liver when passing through the portal circulation. Peak plasma concentration occurs in 1 to 1.5 hours after oral administration. The plasma half-life of propranolol is from 3 to 6 hours. The metabolites of propranolol are excreted through the urine.",

Streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis Bronchopneumonia, bacterial pneumonia Uncomplicated urinary tract infections: pyelonephritis, cystitis Skin and soft tissue infections: abscesses, furunculosis, impetigo, erysipelas, pyoderma, lymphadenitis.",
        "pharmacology": "Cefadroxil inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to 1 or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) which in turn inhibit the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls, thus inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis and arresting cell wall assembly resulting in bacterial cell death.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "The dosage of Cefadroxil depends on the susceptibility of the pathogens, the severity of the disease and on the clinical status of the patient (renal and hepatic function). Streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis - Adult and adolescents >40 kg with normal renal function: 1000 mg once a day over at least 10 days. Dosage may be decreased. Children <40 kg with normal renal function: 30 mg/kg/day once a day over at least 10 days. Bronchopneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, Urinary tract infections, Skin & soft tissue infections - Adult and adolescents >40 kg with normal renal function: 1000 mg twice a day. Children <40 kg with normal renal function: 30-35 mg/kg/day divided into two daily doses. Children may benefit of increased posology up to 100 mg/kg/day. Depending on the severity of the infection, adults may require increased posology. The dosage maximum is 4 g per day. Chronic urinary tract infection may require a prolonged and intensive treatment with continued testing of susceptibility and clinical monitoring. Cefadroxil 500 mg is not recommended for infants and children under 6 years. For younger children and children with a body weight <40 kg, liquid dosage oral form is recommended. Renal impairment patients : In patients with renal impairment, the dose should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance rates to prevent accumulation of cefadroxil. In patients with creatinine clearance of 50 ml/min or less, the following reduced dosage schedule is recommended as a guideline. Creatinine clearance 50-25 ml/min/1.73 m2: 500 mg-1000 mg every 12 hours Creatinine clearance 25-10 ml/min/1.73 m2: 500 mg-1000 mg every 24 hours Creatinine clearance 10-0 ml/min/1.73 m2: 500 mg-1000 mg every 36 hours Children (<40 kg) with renal impairment: Cefadroxil is not indicated in children suffering from renal insufficiency and children requiring haemodialysis. Dosage for haemodialysis patients: Haemodialysis eliminates 63% of 1000 mg of cephalosporin after 6 to 8 hours of haemodialysis. Elimination half-time of cephalosporin is about 3 hours during dialysis. Patients with haemodialysis receive one additional dose ofcefadroxil 500 mg-1000 mg at the end of the haemodialysis. Hepatic impairment : No adjustment of posology is necessary. Elderly: As cefadroxil is excreted by renal route, the dosage should be adjusted if necessary as described under impaired renal function. Mode of administration : Bioavailability is not affected by food and cefadroxil may be taken with meals or on an empty stomach. In case of gastro-intestinal disturbances, it may be administered with food. Duration of therapy : Treatment should be applied for 2 to 3 further days after regression of the acute clinical symptoms or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. In infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes up to 10 days treatment may be considered.",
        "contraindications": "Cefadroxil is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the Cephalosporins. It is also contraindicated in patients with a history of severe reactions to penicillins or to any other beta lactam drugs.Cefadroxil should not be combined with bacteriostatic antibiotics (e.g. tetracycline, erythromycin, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol) since an antagonistic effect is possible.Treatment with cefadroxil in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics, polymyxin B, colistin or high-dose loop diuretics should be avoided since such combinations can potentiate nephrotoxic effects. Cefadroxil does not penetrate in the CSF and is not indicated for the treatment of meningitis. Penicillin is the first drug of choice for the treatment of the Streptococcus pyogenes and for the prevention of rheumatic fever. Data for cefadroxil are not Sufficiently substantial for prophylaxis therapy. Special caution should be exercised in patients with history of severe allergies or asthma. In patients with a history of non severehypersensitity to penicillins, or other non-cephalosporin beta-lactam drugs, cefadroxil should be used with special caution. Caution is necessary in patients with renal impairment; the dosage must be adjusted according to the grade of renal impairment. Cefadroxil should be used with caution in patients with a history of gastro-intestinal disturbances, particularly colitis. The occurrence of diarrhoea may impair the resorption of other medicaments and therefore lead to an impairment of their efficacy. Treatment must be discontinued at once if allergic reactions occur (urticaria, exanthema, pruritus, fall of blood pressure and increased heart rate, respiratory disturbances, collapse, etc.) and suitable countermeasures should be taken (sympathomimetics, corticosteroids and/or antihistaminics). Particularly on prolonged use frequent checks on the blood count and regular hepatic and renal function tests are advisable.Superinfections with fungi (e.g. candida) can occur on prolonged treatment with cefadroxil. In case of severe and persistent diarrhoea, an antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis should be considered. In that case Cefadroxil must be discontinued immediately and a suitable therapy should be started. The result of the Coombs’ test can be transiently positive during or after treatment with cefadroxil. This also applies to Coombs’ tests carried out in newborns whose mothers received treatment with cephalosporins before delivery. Urinary sugar should be determined enzymatically (e.g. with test strips) during treatment with cefadroxil since reduction tests can furnish falsely elevated values.",

        "dosage_and_administration": "The dosage of Cefadroxil depends on the susceptibility of the pathogens, the severity of the disease and on the clinical status of the patient (renal and hepatic function). Streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis - Adult and adolescents >40 kg with normal renal function: 1000 mg once a day over at least 10 days. Dosage may be decreased. Children <40 kg with normal renal function: 30 mg/kg/day once a day over at least 10 days. Bronchopneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, Urinary tract infections, Skin & soft tissue infections - Adult and adolescents >40 kg with normal renal function: 1000 mg twice a day. Children <40 kg with normal renal function: 30-35 mg/kg/day divided into two daily doses. Children may benefit of increased posology up to 100 mg/kg/day. Depending on the severity of the infection, adults may require increased posology. The dosage maximum is 4 g per day. Chronic urinary tract infection may require a prolonged and intensive treatment with continued testing of susceptibility and clinical monitoring. Cefadroxil 500 mg is not recommended for infants and children under 6 years. For younger children and children with a body weight <40 kg, liquid dosage oral form is recommended. Renal impairment patients : In patients with renal impairment, the dose should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance rates to prevent accumulation of cefadroxil. In patients with creatinine clearance of 50 ml/min or less, the following reduced dosage schedule is recommended as a guideline. Creatinine clearance 50-25 ml/min/1.73 m2: 500 mg-1000 mg every 12 hours Creatinine clearance 25-10 ml/min/1.73 m2: 500 mg-1000 mg every 24 hours Creatinine clearance 10-0 ml/min/1.73 m2: 500 mg-1000 mg every 36 hours Children (<40 kg) with renal impairment: Cefadroxil is not indicated in children suffering from renal insufficiency and children requiring haemodialysis. Dosage for haemodialysis patients: Haemodialysis eliminates 63% of 1000 mg of cephalosporin after 6 to 8 hours of haemodialysis. Elimination half-time of cephalosporin is about 3 hours during dialysis. Patients with haemodialysis receive one additional dose ofcefadroxil 500 mg-1000 mg at the end of the haemodialysis. Hepatic impairment : No adjustment of posology is necessary. Elderly: As cefadroxil is excreted by renal route, the dosage should be adjusted if necessary as described under impaired renal function. Mode of administration : Bioavailability is not affected by food and cefadroxil may be taken with meals or on an empty stomach. In case of gastro-intestinal disturbances, it may be administered with food. Duration of therapy : Treatment should be applied for 2 to 3 further days after regression of the acute clinical symptoms or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. In infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes up to 10 days treatment may be considered.",
        "contraindications": "Cefadroxil is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the Cephalosporins. It is also contraindicated in patients with a history of severe reactions to penicillins or to any other beta lactam drugs.Cefadroxil should not be combined with bacteriostatic antibiotics (e.g. tetracycline, erythromycin, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol) since an antagonistic effect is possible.Treatment with cefadroxil in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics, polymyxin B, colistin or high-dose loop diuretics should be avoided since such combinations can potentiate nephrotoxic effects. Cefadroxil does not penetrate in the CSF and is not indicated for the treatment of meningitis. Penicillin is the first drug of choice for the treatment of the Streptococcus pyogenes and for the prevention of rheumatic fever. Data for cefadroxil are not Sufficiently substantial for prophylaxis therapy. Special caution should be exercised in patients with history of severe allergies or asthma. In patients with a history of non severehypersensitity to penicillins, or other non-cephalosporin beta-lactam drugs, cefadroxil should be used with special caution. Caution is necessary in patients with renal impairment; the dosage must be adjusted according to the grade of renal impairment. Cefadroxil should be used with caution in patients with a history of gastro-intestinal disturbances, particularly colitis. The occurrence of diarrhoea may impair the resorption of other medicaments and therefore lead to an impairment of their efficacy. Treatment must be discontinued at once if allergic reactions occur (urticaria, exanthema, pruritus, fall of blood pressure and increased heart rate, respiratory disturbances, collapse, etc.) and suitable countermeasures should be taken (sympathomimetics, corticosteroids and/or antihistaminics). Particularly on prolonged use frequent checks on the blood count and regular hepatic and renal function tests are advisable.Superinfections with fungi (e.g. candida) can occur on prolonged treatment with cefadroxil. In case of severe and persistent diarrhoea, an antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis should be considered. In that case Cefadroxil must be discontinued immediately and a suitable therapy should be started. The result of the Coombs’ test can be transiently positive during or after treatment with cefadroxil. This also applies to Coombs’ tests carried out in newborns whose mothers received treatment with cephalosporins before delivery. Urinary sugar should be determined enzymatically (e.g. with test strips) during treatment with cefadroxil since reduction tests can furnish falsely elevated values.",
        "side_effects": "Infections and infestations : Uncommon side effects are Vaginal mycoses, thrush. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Rare side effects are eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis and very rarely occurs haemolytic anemia. Immune system disorders : Rarely occur serum sickness-like reactions, Very rarely occur immediate allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock). Nervous system disorders : Very rare side effects are Headache, sleeplessness, dizziness, nervousness. Gastrointestinal disorders : Common side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, glossitis and very rarely occurs Pseudomenbranous colitis. Hepatobiliary disorders : Rarely occurs cholestase and idiosyncratic hepatic failure. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Pruritus, rash, allergic exanthema, urticaria are common side effects. Very rarely occurs stevens Johnson syndrom and erythema multiforma. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : Rarely occur arthralgia. Renal and urinary disorders: Rarely occurInterstitial nephritis. General disorders : Fever is rare and fatigue is very rare.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Although animal studies and clinical experience have not shown any evidence of teratogenicity, the safe use during pregnancy has not been established. Cefadroxil is present in low concentrations in breast milk; sensitization, diarrhoea or colonization of the infants’ mucosa with fungi are possible. The use of cefadroxil during pregnancy and in lactating mothers should therefore be handled very strictly.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Adora binds to cholestyramine which may lead to reduced bioavailability of cefadroxil. The concomitant administration of probenecid reduces the renal elimination of cefadroxil; therefore, plasma concentrations of cefadroxil may be increased when given in combination with probenecid.",
        "overdose_effects": "No clinical reports are as yet available on cefadroxil in this respect. However in view of experience gained with other cephalosporins the following symptoms are possible: nausea, hallucinations, hyperreflexia, extrapyramidal symptoms, clouded consciousness, or even coma and renal functional impairment."

It is also indicated for rheumatic & osteoarthritic pain and stiffness of joints.",
        "pharmacology": "Paracetamol exhibits analgesic action by peripheral blockage of pain impulse generation. It produces antipyresis by inhibiting the hypothalamic heat-regulating centre. Its weak anti-inflammatory activity is related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is thought to act primarily in the CNS, increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting both isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3 enzymes involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, thus, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory affects. While aspirin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the enzyme's active site, studies have found that acetaminophen indirectly blocks COX, and that this blockade is ineffective in the presence of peroxides. This might explain why acetaminophen is effective in the central nervous system and in endothelial cells but not in platelets and immune cells which have high levels of peroxides. Studies also report data suggesting that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant of the COX enzyme that is different from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2. This enzyme is now referred to as COX-3. Its exact mechanism of action is still poorly understood, but future research may provide further insight into how it works. The antipyretic properties of acetaminophen are likely due to direct effects on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and hence heat",

Symptoms : Symptoms of Adol overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. Immediate treatment is essential in the management of Adol overdose. Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been taken within 1 hour. Plasma Adol concentration should be measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of Adol. However, the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral Methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or a liver unit."

        "side_effects": "Like all medicines, Admira can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most commonly observed side effect is low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). If left untreated these symptoms could progress to drowsiness, loss of consciousness or possibly coma. If an episode of low blood sugar is severe or prolonged, even if it is temporarily controlled by eating sugar, you should seek immediate medical attention. Liver disorders : There have been isolated reports of abnormal iiver function, which can cause yellow skin and eyes. If you get this, see your doctor immediately. The symptoms generally disappear if the medicine is stopped. Your doctor will decide whether to stop your treatment. Skin disorders : Skin reactions such as rash, redness, itching, hives, blisters, angioedema (rapid swelling of tissues such as eyelids, face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat that may result in breathing difficulty) have been reported. Rash may progress to widespread blistering or peeling of the skin. If you develop this, stop taking, seek urgent advice from a doctor and tell him that you are taking this medicine. Exceptionally, signs of severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported: initially as flu-like symptoms and a rash on the face then an extended rash with a high temperature. Blood disorders : Decrease in the number of cells in the blood (e.g. platelets, red and white blood cells) which may cause paleness, prolonged bleeding, bruising, sore throat and fever have been reported. These symptoms usually vanish when the treatment is discontinued. Digestive disorders : Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, diarrhoea, and constipation. These effects are reduced when Admira is taken with a meal as recommended. Eye disorders : Your vision may be affected for a short time especially at the start of treatment. This effect is due to changes in blood sugar levels. As for another sulfonylurea, the following adverse events have been observed : cases of severe changes in the number of blood cells and allergic inflammation of the wall of blood vessels, reduction in blood sodium (hyponatraemia), symptoms of liver impairment (for instance jaundice) which in most cases disappeared after withdrawal of the sulfonylurea, but may lead to life-threatening liver failure in isolated cases.

        "precautions_and_warnings": "Talk to your doctor before taking Admira. You should observe the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor to achieve proper blood sugar levels. This means, apart from regular tablet intake, to observe the dietary regimen, have physical exercise and, where necessary, reduce weight During Admira treatment regular monitoring of your blood (and possibly urine) sugar level and also your glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is necessary. In the first few weeks of treatment, the risk of having reduced blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) may be increased. So particularly close medical monitoring is necessary. Low blood sugar (Hypoglycaemia) may occur: if you take meals irregularly or skip meals altogether, if you are fasting if you are malnourished if you change your diet if you increase your physical activity and carbohydrate intake does not match this increase, if you drink alcohol, especially in combination with skipped meals, if you take other medicines or natural remedies at the same time, if you take too high doses of Admira, if you suffer from particular hormone-induced disorders (functional disorders of the thyroid gland, pituitary gland or adrenal cortex), if your kidney function or liver function is severely decreased. if you have low blood sugar you may have the following symptoms: headache, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, weariness, sleep disorders, restlessness, aggressiveness, poor concentration, reduced alertness and reaction time, depression, confusion, speech or visual disorders, tremor, sensory disturbances, dizziness and helplessness. The following signs and symptoms may also occur: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, sudden strong pain in the chest that may radiate into nearby areas (angina pectoris). If blood sugar levels continue to drop you may suffer from considerable confusion (delirium), develop convulsions, lose self-control, your breathing may be shallow and your heartbeat slowed down, you may become unconscious. In most cases the symptoms of low blood sugar vanish very quickly when you consume .some form of sugar, (for instance, glucose tablets, sugar cubes, sweet juice, sweetened tea). You should therefore always carry some form of sugar with you (glucose tablets, sugar cubes). Remember that artificial sweeteners are not effective. Please contact your doctor or the nearest hospital if taking sugar does not help or if the symptoms recur. Symptoms of low blood sugar may be absent, less obvious or develop very slowly or you are not aware in time that your blood sugar level has dropped. This may happen if you are an elderly patient taking certain medicines (for instance those acting on the central nervous system and beta-blockers). If you are in stressful situations (e.g. accidents, surgical operations, fever etc.) your doctor may temporarily switch you to insulin therapy. Symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) may occur when Admira has not yet sufficiently reduced the blood sugar when you have not complied with the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor if you take St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations or in special stress situations. These may include thirst, frequent urination, dry mouth, dry itchy skin, skin infections and reduced performance. Blood glucose disturbances (low blood sugar and high bold sugar) can occur when Admira is prescribed at the same time as medicines to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolone, especially in elderly patients. In this case, your doctor will remind you of the importance of monitoring your blood glucose. If you have a family history of or know you have the hereditary condition glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (abnormality of red blood cells), lowering of the haemoglobin level and breakdown of red blood cells (haemolytic anaemia) can occur. Contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. Admira is not recommended for use in children due to lack of data.",

        "unit_price": "৳ 2.00",
        "indications": "Adorex is indicated in- Dyspeptic symptom complex , often associated with delayed gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis: Epigastric sense of fullness, feeling of abdominal distension, upper abdominal pain Eructation, flatulence, early satiety Nausea and vomiting Heartburn with or without regurgitations of gastric contents in the mouth Non-ulcer dyspepsia Acute nausea and vomiting of the functional, organic, infectious, dietetic origin or induced by radiotherapy or drug therapy or induced in migraine. Parkinson's disease : In dopamine-agonist induced nausea and vomiting. Radiological studies : Speeding barium transit in follow-through radiological studies.",
        "pharmacology": "Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist that principally blocks the dopamine receptors located in the ChemoreceptorTrigger Zone (CTZ) and stomach. Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Domperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring. The usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows: Adults : 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily. Children : 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. In dyspeptic symptom: Adults : 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. Children : 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. In acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting): Adults : 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily Children : 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks). By rectum in suppositories: Adults (including elderly) : 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours. Children : The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary. The maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.",
        "contraindications": "Domperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).",
        "side_effects": "Side-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Domperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Adorex should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.",
        "overdose_effects": "Symptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions."

Streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis Bronchopneumonia, bacterial pneumonia Uncomplicated urinary tract infections: pyelonephritis, cystitis Skin and soft tissue infections: abscesses, furunculosis, impetigo, erysipelas, pyoderma, lymphadenitis.",
        "pharmacology": "Cefadroxil inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to 1 or more of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) which in turn inhibit the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls, thus inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis and arresting cell wall assembly resulting in bacterial cell death.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "The dosage of Cefadroxil depends on the susceptibility of the pathogens, the severity of the disease and on the clinical status of the patient (renal and hepatic function). Streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis - Adult and adolescents >40 kg with normal renal function: 1000 mg once a day over at least 10 days. Dosage may be decreased. Children <40 kg with normal renal function: 30 mg/kg/day once a day over at least 10 days. Bronchopneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, Urinary tract infections, Skin & soft tissue infections - Adult and adolescents >40 kg with normal renal function: 1000 mg twice a day. Children <40 kg with normal renal function: 30-35 mg/kg/day divided into two daily doses. Children may benefit of increased posology up to 100 mg/kg/day. Depending on the severity of the infection, adults may require increased posology. The dosage maximum is 4 g per day. Chronic urinary tract infection may require a prolonged and intensive treatment with continued testing of susceptibility and clinical monitoring. Cefadroxil 500 mg is not recommended for infants and children under 6 years. For younger children and children with a body weight <40 kg, liquid dosage oral form is recommended. Renal impairment patients : In patients with renal impairment, the dose should be adjusted according to creatinine clearance rates to prevent accumulation of cefadroxil. In patients with creatinine clearance of 50 ml/min or less, the following reduced dosage schedule is recommended as a guideline. Creatinine clearance 50-25 ml/min/1.73 m2: 500 mg-1000 mg every 12 hours Creatinine clearance 25-10 ml/min/1.73 m2: 500 mg-1000 mg every 24 hours Creatinine clearance 10-0 ml/min/1.73 m2: 500 mg-1000 mg every 36 hours Children (<40 kg) with renal impairment: Cefadroxil is not indicated in children suffering from renal insufficiency and children requiring haemodialysis. Dosage for haemodialysis patients: Haemodialysis eliminates 63% of 1000 mg of cephalosporin after 6 to 8 hours of haemodialysis. Elimination half-time of cephalosporin is about 3 hours during dialysis. Patients with haemodialysis receive one additional dose ofcefadroxil 500 mg-1000 mg at the end of the haemodialysis. Hepatic impairment : No adjustment of posology is necessary. Elderly: As cefadroxil is excreted by renal route, the dosage should be adjusted if necessary as described under impaired renal function. Mode of administration : Bioavailability is not affected by food and cefadroxil may be taken with meals or on an empty stomach. In case of gastro-intestinal disturbances, it may be administered with food. Duration of therapy : Treatment should be applied for 2 to 3 further days after regression of the acute clinical symptoms or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. In infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes up to 10 days treatment may be considered.",

Cefadroxil does not penetrate in the CSF and is not indicated for the treatment of meningitis. Penicillin is the first drug of choice for the treatment of the Streptococcus pyogenes and for the prevention of rheumatic fever. Data for cefadroxil are not Sufficiently substantial for prophylaxis therapy. Special caution should be exercised in patients with history of severe allergies or asthma. In patients with a history of non severehypersensitity to penicillins, or other non-cephalosporin beta-lactam drugs, cefadroxil should be used with special caution. Caution is necessary in patients with renal impairment; the dosage must be adjusted according to the grade of renal impairment. Cefadroxil should be used with caution in patients with a history of gastro-intestinal disturbances, particularly colitis. The occurrence of diarrhoea may impair the resorption of other medicaments and therefore lead to an impairment of their efficacy. Treatment must be discontinued at once if allergic reactions occur (urticaria, exanthema, pruritus, fall of blood pressure and increased heart rate, respiratory disturbances, collapse, etc.) and suitable countermeasures should be taken (sympathomimetics, corticosteroids and/or antihistaminics). Particularly on prolonged use frequent checks on the blood count and regular hepatic and renal function tests are advisable.Superinfections with fungi (e.g. candida) can occur on prolonged treatment with cefadroxil. In case of severe and persistent diarrhoea, an antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis should be considered. In that case Cefadroxil must be discontinued immediately and a suitable therapy should be started. The result of the Coombs’ test can be transiently positive during or after treatment with cefadroxil. This also applies to Coombs’ tests carried out in newborns whose mothers received treatment with cephalosporins before delivery.

Parkinson's disease : In dopamine-agonist induced nausea and vomiting. Radiological studies : Speeding barium transit in follow-through radiological studies.",
        "pharmacology": "Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist that principally blocks the dopamine receptors located in the ChemoreceptorTrigger Zone (CTZ) and stomach. Its gastroprokinetic action is based on its blocking effect of dopamine receptors that have an influence on the motility of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to its weak penetration across the blood-brain barrier, Domperidone has almost no effect on the dopaminergic receptors in the brain, therefore, excluding psychotropic and neurologic side effects. Domperidone restores normal motility and tone of the upper gastrointestinal tract, facilitates gastric emptying, enhances antral and duodenal peristalsis and regulates contraction of the pylorus. Domperidone also increases esophageal peristalsis and lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and thus prevents regurgitation of gastric content.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Domperidone should be taken 15-30 minutes before meals and, if necessary, before retiring. The usual recommended oral dose of Domperidone is as follows: Adults : 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. The maximum dose of Domperidone is 80 mg daily. Children : 2-4 ml suspension/10 kg body weight or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. In dyspeptic symptom: Adults : 10-20 mg (1-2 tablet or 10-20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily. Children : 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. In acute and sub-acute conditions (mainly in acute nausea and vomiting): Adults : 20 mg (2 tablets or 20 ml suspension), every 6-8 hours daily Children : 0.2-0.4 mg/kg (2-4 ml suspension/10 kg or 0.4-0.8 ml paediatric drops/10 kg) body weight, every 6-8 hours daily. (In acute nausea and vomiting maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks). By rectum in suppositories: Adults (including elderly) : 30-60 mg every 4-8 hours. Children : The maximum daily dose rectally in children's is 30 mg for those weighting 10 to 25 kg. The dose may be divided throughout day if necessary. The maximum period of treatment is 12 weeks.",
        "contraindications": "Domperidone is contraindicated to patients having known hypersensitivity to this drug and in the case of neonates. Domperidone should not be used whenever gastrointestinal stimulation might be dangerous i.e., gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction or perforation. Also contraindicated in patients with prolactin releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).",
        "side_effects": "Side-effects are rare; exceptionally some transient intestinal cramps have been reported. Extrapyramidal phenomena are rare in young children and exceptional in adults: they reverse spontaneously and completely as soon as the treatment is stopped. As the pituitary gland is located outside the blood-brain barrier, domperidone may induce an increase in the plasma prolactin level. In rare case this hyperprolactinaemia may give rise to neuroendocrinological phenomena such as galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia. When the blood-brain barrier is immature (as in infants) or impaired, the possible occurrence of neurological side-effects cannot be totally excluded. Rare allergic reactions, such as rash and urticaria, have also been reported.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Domperidone given to animals at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day did not produce teratogenic effects. However, as most medicines, domperidone should only be used during the first trimester of pregnancy if this is justified by the anticipated therapeutic benefit. Up to now, there has been no evidence of any increase in the risk of malformations in humans. The drug is excreted in breast milk of lactating rats. In women, domperidone concentrations in breast milk is 4 times lower than corresponding plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this is harmful to the newborn. Therefore nursing is not recommended for mothers who are taking domperidone, unless the expected benefits outweigh any potential risk. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Domperidone does not affect the mental alertness.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Adorex should be used with absolute caution in the case of children because there may be an increased risk of extra-pyramidal reactions in young children because of an incompletely developed blood-brain barrier. Since domperidone is highly metabolized in liver, it should be used with caution in patient with hepatic impairment.",
        "overdose_effects": "Symptoms of overdosage may include drowsiness, disorientation and extrapyramidal reactions, especially in children. In case of overdosage, the administration of activated charcoal, and close observation of the patients are recommended. Anticholinergic, antiparkinson drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties may be helpful in controlling the extrapyramidal reactions."

        "pharmacology": "Ketoconazole interacts with 14-α-sterol demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. This results in inhibition of ergosterol synthesis and increased fungal cellular permeability due to reduced amounts of ergosterol present in the fungal cell membrane. This metabolic inhibition also results in accumulation of 14α-methyl-3,6-diol, a toxic metabolite. The increase in membrane fluidity is also thought to produce impairment of membrane-bound enzyme systems as components become less closely packed.",

Admira MR is used in a certain form of diabetes (type 2 diabetes Mellitus) in adults, when diet, exercise and weight loss alone do not have an adequate effect on keeping blood sugar at the correct level.",
        "pharmacology": "Gliclazide is a second generation sulfonylurea drug that has hypoglycaemic and potentially useful hematological properties. It stimulates the release of insulin from pancreatic β-cells by facilitating Ca +2 transport across the β-cell membranes and decreases hepatic glucose output.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Film-coated tablet : The usual initial dose is 40 to 80 mg daily. The dose can be increased up to 320 mg daily in divided doses when needed. The drug should be taken before meal. For children, Gliclazide is not used because it is contraindicated in juvenile-onset diabetes. Modified release preparation : Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The dose is determined by the doctor, depending on your blood and possibly urine sugar levels. Change in external factors (weight reduction, lifestyle, stress) or improvements in the blood sugar control may require changed gliclazide doses. The recommended daily dose is one to four tablets (maximum 120 mg) in a single intake at breakfast time. This depends on the response to treatment. Gliclazide MR tablet is for oral use. Take your tablet(s) with a glass of water at breakfast time (and preferably at the same time each day). Swallow your whole tablet(s) in one piece. Do not chew or crush. You must always eat a meal after taking your tablet(s). If a combination therapy of gliclazide with metformin, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, a thiazolidinedione, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor a GLP-1 receptor agonist or insulin is initiated your doctor will determine the proper dose of each medicine individually for you. If you notice that your blood sugar levels are high although you are taking the medicine as prescribed, you should contact your doctor or pharmacist. If you take more Gliclazide tablets than you should : If you take too many tablets, contact your doctor or the nearest hospital Accident & Emergency department immediately. The signs of overdose are those of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). The symptoms can be helped by taking sugar (4 to 6 lumps) or sugary drinks straight away, followed by a substantial snack or meal. If the patient is unconscious immediately inform a doctor and call the emergency services. The same should be done if somebody, (for instance a child), has taken the product unintentionally. Unconscious patients must not be given food or drink. It should be ensured that there is always a pre-informed person that can call a doctor in case of emergency. If you forget to take Gliclazide tablet : It is important to take your medicine every day as regular treatment works better. However, if you forget to take a dose of Gliclazide MR tablet, take the next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you stop taking Gliclazide MR tablet : As the treatment for diabetes is usually lifelong, you should discuss with your doctor before stopping this medicinal product. Stopping could cause high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) which increases the risk of developing complications of diabetes. If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.",
        "contraindications": "Do not take Gliclazide: if you are allergic to gliclazide or to other medicines of the same group (sulfonylurea), or to other related medicines (hypoglycaemic sulfonamides) if you have insulin-dependent diabetes (type 1) if you have ketone bodies and sugar in your urine (this may mean you have diabetic ketoacidosis), a diabetic pre-coma or coma if you have severe kidney or liver disease if you are taking medicines to treat fungal infections if you are breastfeeding",
        "side_effects": "Like all medicines, Admira MR can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. The most commonly observed side effect is low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). If left untreated these symptoms could progress to drowsiness, loss of consciousness or possibly coma. If an episode of low blood sugar is severe or prolonged, even if it is temporarily controlled by eating sugar, you should seek immediate medical attention. Liver disorders : There have been isolated reports of abnormal iiver function, which can cause yellow skin and eyes. If you get this, see your doctor immediately. The symptoms generally disappear if the medicine is stopped. Your doctor will decide whether to stop your treatment. Skin disorders : Skin reactions such as rash, redness, itching, hives, blisters, angioedema (rapid swelling of tissues such as eyelids, face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat that may result in breathing difficulty) have been reported. Rash may progress to widespread blistering or peeling of the skin. If you develop this, stop taking, seek urgent advice from a doctor and tell him that you are taking this medicine. Exceptionally, signs of severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported: initially as flu-like symptoms and a rash on the face then an extended rash with a high temperature. Blood disorders : Decrease in the number of cells in the blood (e.g. platelets, red and white blood cells) which may cause paleness, prolonged bleeding, bruising, sore throat and fever have been reported. These symptoms usually vanish when the treatment is discontinued. Digestive disorders : Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, diarrhoea, and constipation. These effects are reduced when Admira MR is taken with a meal as recommended. Eye disorders : Your vision may be affected for a short time especially at the start of treatment. This effect is due to changes in blood sugar levels. As for another sulfonylurea, the following adverse events have been observed : cases of severe changes in the number of blood cells and allergic inflammation of the wall of blood vessels, reduction in blood sodium (hyponatraemia), symptoms of liver impairment (for instance jaundice) which in most cases disappeared after withdrawal of the sulfonylurea, but may lead to life-threatening liver failure in isolated cases. Reporting of side effects : If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. By reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Gliclazide is not recommended for use during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. You must not take Gliclazide while you are breastfeeding.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Talk to your doctor before taking Admira MR. You should observe the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor to achieve proper blood sugar levels. This means, apart from regular tablet intake, to observe the dietary regimen, have physical exercise and, where necessary, reduce weight During Admira MR treatment regular monitoring of your blood (and possibly urine) sugar level and also your glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is necessary. In the first few weeks of treatment, the risk of having reduced blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia) may be increased. So particularly close medical monitoring is necessary. Low blood sugar (Hypoglycaemia) may occur: if you take meals irregularly or skip meals altogether, if you are fasting if you are malnourished if you change your diet if you increase your physical activity and carbohydrate intake does not match this increase, if you drink alcohol, especially in combination with skipped meals, if you take other medicines or natural remedies at the same time, if you take too high doses of Admira MR, if you suffer from particular hormone-induced disorders (functional disorders of the thyroid gland, pituitary gland or adrenal cortex), if your kidney function or liver function is severely decreased. if you have low blood sugar you may have the following symptoms: headache, intense hunger, nausea, vomiting, weariness, sleep disorders, restlessness, aggressiveness, poor concentration, reduced alertness and reaction time, depression, confusion, speech or visual disorders, tremor, sensory disturbances, dizziness and helplessness. The following signs and symptoms may also occur: sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, sudden strong pain in the chest that may radiate into nearby areas (angina pectoris). If blood sugar levels continue to drop you may suffer from considerable confusion (delirium), develop convulsions, lose self-control, your breathing may be shallow and your heartbeat slowed down, you may become unconscious. In most cases the symptoms of low blood sugar vanish very quickly when you consume .some form of sugar, (for instance, glucose tablets, sugar cubes, sweet juice, sweetened tea). You should therefore always carry some form of sugar with you (glucose tablets, sugar cubes). Remember that artificial sweeteners are not effective. Please contact your doctor or the nearest hospital if taking sugar does not help or if the symptoms recur. Symptoms of low blood sugar may be absent, less obvious or develop very slowly or you are not aware in time that your blood sugar level has dropped. This may happen if you are an elderly patient taking certain medicines (for instance those acting on the central nervous system and beta-blockers). If you are in stressful situations (e.g. accidents, surgical operations, fever etc.) your doctor may temporarily switch you to insulin therapy. Symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) may occur when Admira MR has not yet sufficiently reduced the blood sugar when you have not complied with the treatment plan prescribed by your doctor if you take St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations or in special stress situations. These may include thirst, frequent urination, dry mouth, dry itchy skin, skin infections and reduced performance. Blood glucose disturbances (low blood sugar and high bold sugar) can occur when Admira MR is prescribed at the same time as medicines to a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolone, especially in elderly patients. In this case, your doctor will remind you of the importance of monitoring your blood glucose. If you have a family history of or know you have the hereditary condition glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (abnormality of red blood cells), lowering of the haemoglobin level and breakdown of red blood cells (haemolytic anaemia) can occur. Contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. Admira MR is not recommended for use in children due to lack of data.",

        "pharmacology": "Bisoprolol Fumarate is the most selective ß1 blocker. It displays highest level of affinity for the ß1 receptor than any other beta-blocker available up to now. Selectively blocks ß1 adrenergic receptor in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and reduces heart rate and cardiac output resulting in decrease of arterial hypertension. Lipid metabolism can be adversely affected by ß-blockers, in patients with non-ß1 selective ß1-blocker, but Bisoprolol does not cause any change in the cholesterol fraction including the cardioprotective HDL-cholesterol, in long-term therapy. The pharmacokinetic properties of Bisoprolol provide the prerequisite for a single daily dose and ensure an extremely low inter and intra-individual variability of the plasma concentration profiles. The high therapeutic reliability of Bisoprolol is based on these properties. Absorption and bioavailability : Bisoprolol is almost completely (>90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The high absorption rate and the small first-pass effect (<10%) lead to an absolute bioavailability of 88%. Concomitant food intake does not affect the absorption. Distribution: Bisoprolol is extensively distributed. The medium distribution volume is 3.51/kg. Metabolism : Bisoprolol is metabolized via oxidative pathways with no subsequent conjugation. All metabolites, being very polar, are renally eliminated. The major metabolites in human plasma and urine were found to be without pharmacological activity. In vitro data from studies in human liver microsomes show that Bisoprolol is primarily metabolized via CYPSA4 (-95%) with CYP2D6 having only a minor role. Elimination : The clearance of Bisoprolol is balanced between renal elimination of the unchanged molecule (-50%) and hepatic metabolism (-50%) to metabolites which are also renally excreted. The total clearance of Bisoprolol is approximately 15 I/h. Bisoprolol has an elimination half-life of 10-12 hours.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Adult : In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, Bisoprolol fumarate must be individualized to the needs of the patient. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily either added to a diuretic or alone. If the response to 5 mg is inadequate, the dose may be increased to 10 mg and then, if necessary, to 20 mg once daily. An appropriate interval for dose titration is 2 weeks. Increasing the dose beyond 20 mg once daily produces only a small incremental benefit. Children : Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established. Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment : In patients with hepatic impairment (hepatitis or cirrhosis) or renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 40 mL/min) as in other patients, the initial daily dose should be 5 mg. Because of the possibility of accumulation, caution must be used in dose titration. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialysable, drug replacement is not necessary in patients undergoing dialysis. Geriatrics : In the elderly, it is not usually necessary to adjust the dose, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction",

Bisoprolol fumarate was fetotoxic (increased late resorptions) at 50 mg/kg/day and maternotoxic (decreased food intake and body-weight gain) at 150 mg/kg/day. Bisoprolol fumarate was not teratogenic in rabbits at doses up to 12.5 mg/kg/day, which is 31 times the maximum recommended human daily dose, but was embryolethal (increased early resorptions) at 12.5 mg/kg/day. There are no studies in pregnant women. Bisoprolol fumarate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Lactation : Small amounts of bisoprolol fumarate (<2% of the dose) have been detected in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. If use of bisoprolol fumarate is considered essential, then mothers should stop nursing.",

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC 4 , LTD 4 , LTE 4 ) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.",

Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults. Hepatic Insufficiency : No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. Renal Insufficiency : No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency. Elderly use : The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults.

        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Montelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast is given to a nursing mother.",

Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Aeron can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Aeron should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Aeron should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Aeron. Although Aeron is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.",

        "pharmacology": "Adalimumab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF-alpha and blocks its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also lyses surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Elevated levels of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased levels of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Plaque Psoriasis, treatment with Adalimumab may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells.",

When given by slow intravenous injection, epinephrine usually produces only a moderate rise in systolic and a fall in diastolic pressure. Although some increase in pulse pressure occurs, there is usually no great elevation in mean blood pressure.

        "indications": "Aegis is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms. Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI) : e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis. Urinary Tract Infections : e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. Aegis is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
        "pharmacology": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years : The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly : Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children : The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid : the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years : Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months : The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months. Dosage in Renal Impairment : Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",

Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with Aegis are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Aegis should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with Aegis, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. Aegis should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Aegis should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
        "overdose_effects": "Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. Aegis is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

        "pharmacology": "Albendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activities. The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

The main molecular target of Zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, but this does not exclude other mechanisms. Clinical studies in tumour-induced hypercalcemia demonstrated that the effect of Zoledronic acid is characterized by decreases in serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion. In addition to its inhibitory activity against bone resorption, Zoledronic acid also possesses anti-tumour activity, anti-angiogenic activity, anti-pain activity, cytostatic and pro-apoptotic activity on tumour cells and synergistic cytostatic effect with other anti-cancer drugs.

It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms. Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI) : e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis. Urinary Tract Infections : e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. Aegis is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
        "pharmacology": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years : The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly : Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children : The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid : the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years : Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months : The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months. Dosage in Renal Impairment : Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",

Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with Aegis are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",

        "precautions_and_warnings": "Aegis should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with Aegis, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. Aegis should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Aegis should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
        "overdose_effects": "Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. Aegis is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

        "pharmacology": "The actions of epinephrine resemble the effects of stimulation of adrenergic nerves. It acts on both alpha and beta receptor sites of sympathetic effector cells. Its most prominent actions are on the beta receptors of the heart, vascular and other smooth muscle. When given by rapid intravenous injection, it produces a rapid rise in blood pressure, mainly systolic, by (1) direct stimulation of cardiac muscle which increases the strength of ventricular contraction, (2) increasing the heart rate and (3) constriction of the arterioles in the skin, mucosa and splanchnic areas of the circulation. When given by slow intravenous injection, epinephrine usually produces only a moderate rise in systolic and a fall in diastolic pressure. Although some increase in pulse pressure occurs, there is usually no great elevation in mean blood pressure. Accordingly, the compensatory reflex mechanisms that come into play with a pronounced increase in blood pressure do not antagonize the direct cardiac actions of epinephrine as much as with catecholamines that have a predominant action on alpha receptors.",

Amlodipine : Hypertension: Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents; Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Chronic Stable Angina: Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal or antihypertensive agents; Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal's or Variant Angina): Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. Amlodipine may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal drugs. Angiographically Documented CAD: In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction <40%, Amlodipine is indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization due to angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure. Atorvastatin : Atorvastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total cholesterol, LDL- cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and triglyceride levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types lla and llb), adjunctive therapy to diet for the treatment of patients with elevated serum triglyceride levels (Fredrickson Type IV), for the treatment of patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson Type III) who do not respond adequately to diet, to reduce total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as an adjunct to other lipid lowering treatments (e.g. LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable. At the time of hospitalization for an acute coronary event, consideration can be given to initiating drug therapy at discharge if the LDL-C level is >100 mg/dL (NCEP-ATP III). Prior to initiating therapy with Atorvastatin, secondary causes for hypercholesterolemia (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemias, obstructive liver disease, other drug therapy, and alcoholism) should be excluded, and a lipid profile performed to measure total-C, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG.",

Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. Atorvastatin calcium is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent. It is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA). This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoAto mevatonate, an early and rate limiting step in the synthesis of cholesterol.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Amlodipine : The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose is 5 mg once daily with a maximum dose of 10 mg once daily. Elderly individuals or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily dose and this dose may be used when adding Amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy. Dosage should be adjusted according to each patient's need. The recommended dose for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5-10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Atorvastatin : The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet before receiving Atorvastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment with Atorvastatin Hypercholesterolemia (Heterozygous Familial and Nonfamilial) and Mixed Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb): The recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 mg daily. The dosage range is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day with or without food. Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The dosage of Atorvastatin in patients with homozygous FH is 10 to 80 mg daily. Patients with renal insufficiency: Renal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or lipid effects of Atorvastatin; thus no adjustment of dose is required. Hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance the clearance of Atorvastatin since the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins. Patients with hepatic dysfunction: In patients with moderate to severe hepatic dysfunction, the therapeutic response to Atorvastatin is unaffected but exposure to the drug is greatly increased.",

        "pharmacology": "Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus, and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti-tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner.",

        "pharmacology": "The H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity.

        "pharmacology": "Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus, and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti-tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner.",

As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years : The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly : Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children : The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid : the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years : Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months : The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months. Dosage in Renal Impairment : Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded.

        "precautions_and_warnings": "Afix should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with Afix, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. Afix should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Afix should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
        "overdose_effects": "Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. Afix is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

        "pharmacology": "The H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.",

Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. Afix is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
        "pharmacology": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years : The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly : Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children : The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid : the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years : Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months : The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months. Dosage in Renal Impairment : Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.",
        "contraindications": "Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalosporin antibiotics.",
        "side_effects": "Afix is generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with Afix are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known that Cefixime is excreted in human milk. So, caution should be exercised when Cefixime is administered to a nursing woman.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Afix should be given with caution to patients who have shown hypersensitivity to other drugs. Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with Afix, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. Afix should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Afix should therefore not be used in pregnancy or in nursing mothers unless considered essential by the physician.",
        "overdose_effects": "Gastric Lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. Afix is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of Afix did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses."

        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Fluconazole adverse fetal efects have been seen in animals only at dose levels associated with maternal toxicity. These levels are many times in excess of those recommended for therapeutic use. There has been little use during human pregnancy. Accordingly, fuconazole should not be used in pregnancy or in women of child bearing potential unless adequate contraception is employed.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "in some patients, particularly those with serious underlying diseases such as AIDS and cancer, abnormalities of hepatic, renal, haematological and other biochemical function tests have been observed during treatment with fuconazole, but the clinical signifcance and relationship to treatment is uncertain. Very rarely. patients who died with severe underlying disease and who had received multiple dose fuconazole, had post-mortem fndings which included hapatic necrosis. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs. Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop. Use during lactation: Afluzole is found in human breast milk at concentrations similar to plasma. hence its use in nursing mothers is not recommended. Driving/Use of machinery: Experience with fuconazole indicates that therapy a unlikely to impair a patient's ability to drive or use machinery.",
        "overdose_effects": "In the event of overdosage, supportive measures and symptomatic treatment with gastric lavage if necessary may be adequate. As fuconazole is excreted largely in the urine, forced volume diuresis would probably increase the elimination rate.

        "pharmacology": "Budesonide is a synthetic corticosteroid having potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. It has approximately a 200-fold higher affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and a 1000-fold higher topical anti-inflammatory potency than cortisol. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cell, eosinophil, neutrophil, macrophage, and lymphocyte) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotriene, and cytokine) involved in allergic mediated inflammation.",
        "dosage_and_administration": null,
        "contraindications": "Budesonide is not indicated for the treatment of acute dyspnoea or status asthmaticus. These conditions should be treated with short acting β-sympathomimetics and other bronchodilators.",
        "side_effects": "The following definitions apply to the incidence of undesirable effects: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Facial irritation, as an example of a hypersensitivity reaction, has occurred in some cases when a Nebuliser with a face mask has been used. To prevent irritation the facial skin should be washed with water after use of the face mask. In-placebo controlled studies, cataract was also uncommonly reported in the placebo group. Clinical trials with 13,119 patients on inhaled Aeronid and 7,278 patients on placebo have been pooled. The frequency of anxiety was 0.52% on inhaled Aeronid and 0.63% on placebo; that of depression was 0.67% on inhaled Aeronid and 1.15% on placebo. There is an increased risk of pneumonia in patients with newly diagnosed COPD starting treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. However a weighted assessment of 8 pooled clinical trials involving 4643 COPD patients treated with Aeronid and 3,643 patients randomized to non-ICS treatments did not demonstrate an increased risk for pneumonia. The results from the first 7 of these 8 trials have been published as a meta-analysis. Treatment with inhaled Aeronid may result in candida infection in the oropharynx. Experience has shown that candida infection occurs less often when inhalation is performed before meals and/or when the mouth is rinsed after inhalation. In most cases this condition responds to topical anti-fungal therapy without discontinuing treatment with inhaled Aeronid. Coughing can usually be prevented by inhaling a beta-2 agonist (e.g. terbutaline) 5-10 minutes before administration of Aeronid 0.5mg Nebuliser Suspension. Occasionally, signs or symptoms of systemic glucocorticosteroid-side effects may occur with inhaled glucocorticosteroids, probably depending on dose, exposure time, concomitant and previous corticosteroid exposure, and individual sensitivity. These may include adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma, and susceptibility to infections. The ability to adapt to stress may be impaired. The systemic effects described, however, are much less likely to occur with inhaled Aeronid than with oral corticosteroids.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Pregnancy : There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It is important for both foetus and mother to maintain an adequate asthma treatment during pregnancy. As with other drugs administered during pregnancy, the benefit of the administration of budesonide for the mother should be weighed against the risks to the foetus. Breastfeeding : Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses of budesonide no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Budesonide can be used during breast feeding. Maintenance treatment with inhaled budesonide (200 or 400 micrograms twice daily) in asthmatic nursing women results in negligible systemic exposure to budesonide in breast-fed infants. In a pharmacokinetic study, the estimated daily infant dose was 0.3% of the daily maternal dose for both dose levels, and the average plasma concentration in infants was estimated to be 1/600th of the concentrations observed in maternal plasma, assuming complete infant oral bioavailability. Budesonide concentrations in infant plasma samples were all less than the limit of quantification. Based on data from inhaled budesonide and the fact that budesonide exhibits linear PK properties within the therapeutic dosage intervals after nasal, inhaled, oral and rectal administrations, at therapeutic doses of budesonide, exposure to the suckling child is anticipated to be low.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "The transfer of patients treated with oral corticosteroids to the inhaled corticosteroid and their subsequent management requires special care. The patients should be in a reasonably stable state before initiating a high dose of inhaled corticosteroid in addition to their usual maintenance dose of systemic corticosteroid. After about 10 days, withdrawal of the systemic corticosteroid is started by reducing the daily dose gradually (by for example 2.5 milligrams prednisolone or the equivalent each month) to the lowest possible level. It may be possible to completely replace the oral corticosteroid with inhaled corticosteroid. Transferred patients whose adrenocortical function is impaired may need supplementary systemic corticosteroid during periods of stress e.g. surgery, infection or worsening asthma attacks. Patients who have required high dose emergency corticosteroid therapy or prolonged treatment at the highest recommended dose of inhaled corticosteroids, may also be at risk of impaired adrenal function. These patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to severe stress. Additional systemic corticosteroid treatment should be considered during periods of stress or elective surgery. During transfer from oral therapy to inhaled Aeronid, symptoms may appear that had previously been suppressed by systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids, for example symptoms of allergic rhinitis, eczema, muscle and joint pain. Specific treatment should be co-administered to treat these conditions. Some patients may feel unwell in a non-specific way during the withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids despite maintenance or even improvement in respiratory function. Such patients should be encouraged to continue treatment with inhaled Aeronid and withdrawal of oral corticosteroid unless there are clinical signs to indicate the contrary, for example signs which might indicate adrenal insufficiency. As with other inhalation therapies paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, manifested by an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. Paradoxical bronchospasm responds to a rapid-acting inhaled bronchodilator and should be treated straight away. Aeronid should be discontinued immediately, the patient should be assessed and, if necessary, alternative treatment instituted. When an acute episode of dyspnoea occurs despite a well monitored treatment, a rapid-acting inhaled bronchodilator should be used and medical reassessment should be considered. If despite maximum doses of inhaled corticosteroids, asthma symptoms are not adequately controlled, patients may require short-term treatment with systemic corticosteroids. In such cases, it is necessary to maintain the inhaled corticosteroid therapy in association with treatment by the systemic route. Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods. These effects are much less likely to occur with inhalation treatment than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects include Cushing’s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract, glaucoma and more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children). It is important, therefore, that the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained. Influence on growth: It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re-evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition, consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist. Patients who have previously been dependent on oral corticosteroids may, as a result of prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy, experience effects of impaired adrenal function. Recovery may take a considerable amount of time after cessation of oral corticosteroid therapy and hence oral steroid-dependent patients transferred to Aeronid may remain at risk from impaired adrenocortical function for some considerable time. In such circumstances hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis function should be monitored regularly. Oral candidiasis may occur during the therapy with inhaled corticosteroids. This infection may require treatment with appropriate antifungal therapy and in some patients discontinuation of treatment may be necessary Exacerbation of clinical symptoms of asthma may be due to acute respiratory tract bacterial infections and treatment with appropriate antibiotics may be required. Such patients may need to increase the dose of inhaled Aeronid and a short course of oral corticosteroids may be required. A rapid-acting inhaled bronchodilator should be used as “rescue” medication to relieve acute asthma symptoms. Special care and adequate specific therapeutic control of patients with active and quiescent pulmonary tuberculosis is necessary before commencing treatment with inhaled Aeronid. Similarly patients with fungal, viral or other infections of the airways require close observation and special care and should use Aeronid only if they are also receiving adequate treatment for such infections. In patients with excessive mucous secretion in the respiratory tract, short-term therapy with oral corticosteroids may be necessary. In patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, treatment with inhaled Aeronid can result in a reduced elimination rate and hence enhanced systemic availability. Possible systemic effects may then result and therefore HPA axis function in these patients should be monitored at regular intervals. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole, HIV protease inhibitors or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided. If this is not possible the time interval between administration of the two drugs should be as long as possible. Recent epidemiological studies show that there is an increased incidence of pneumonia in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with inhaled corticosteroids, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.7. Care should be exercised in prescribing Aeronid for those patients whose respiratory disease might have a component of COPD. Visual disturbance: Visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical corticosteroids. Aeronid Nebuliser Suspension should be used with a jet Nebuliser device. An ultrasonic Nebuliser should not be used as this is not appropriate for Nebuliser suspensions.",
        "overdose_effects": "Symptoms: Acute overdose with Aeronid usually does not constitute a clinical problem. The only harmful effect after a large amount of sprays during a short period is a suppression of the cortex function. If it is a matter of chronic use of very high doses, effects such as a degree of cortex atrophy in addition to adrenocortical suppression may occur. Acute overdosage : There is no need for acute measures. The treatment with Aeronid should be continued with the lowest possible effective maintenance dose, and the adrenocortical function will repair itself automatically within 1-2 days. Chronic overdosage : The patient should be treated as a steroid dependent and be transferred to a suitable maintenance dose with a systemic steroid, for example prednisolone. When the condition is stabilized, the patient should continue the treatment with the inhalation of Aeronid at the recommended dose."

        "indications": "Afixime is an orally active cephalosporin antibiotic which has marked in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms. Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI) : e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis. Urinary Tract Infections : e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. Afixime is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",
        "pharmacology": "Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration. It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. Adults and children over 10 years : The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly : Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children : The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid : the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years : Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months : The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months. Dosage in Renal Impairment : Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function.

        "pharmacology": "The H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity. Fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier and thus is unlikely to cause significant CNS effects.",

Aeron should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Aeron.

        "side_effects": "The following definitions apply to the incidence of undesirable effects: Very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Facial irritation, as an example of a hypersensitivity reaction, has occurred in some cases when a Nebuliser with a face mask has been used. To prevent irritation the facial skin should be washed with water after use of the face mask. In-placebo controlled studies, cataract was also uncommonly reported in the placebo group. Clinical trials with 13,119 patients on inhaled Aeronid and 7,278 patients on placebo have been pooled. The frequency of anxiety was 0.52% on inhaled Aeronid and 0.63% on placebo; that of depression was 0.67% on inhaled Aeronid and 1.15% on placebo. There is an increased risk of pneumonia in patients with newly diagnosed COPD starting treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. However a weighted assessment of 8 pooled clinical trials involving 4643 COPD patients treated with Aeronid and 3,643 patients randomized to non-ICS treatments did not demonstrate an increased risk for pneumonia. The results from the first 7 of these 8 trials have been published as a meta-analysis. Treatment with inhaled Aeronid may result in candida infection in the oropharynx. Experience has shown that candida infection occurs less often when inhalation is performed before meals and/or when the mouth is rinsed after inhalation. In most cases this condition responds to topical anti-fungal therapy without discontinuing treatment with inhaled Aeronid. Coughing can usually be prevented by inhaling a beta-2 agonist (e.g. terbutaline) 5-10 minutes before administration of Aeronid 0.5mg Nebuliser Suspension. Occasionally, signs or symptoms of systemic glucocorticosteroid-side effects may occur with inhaled glucocorticosteroids, probably depending on dose, exposure time, concomitant and previous corticosteroid exposure, and individual sensitivity. These may include adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma, and susceptibility to infections. The ability to adapt to stress may be impaired. The systemic effects described, however, are much less likely to occur with inhaled Aeronid than with oral corticosteroids.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Pregnancy : There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It is important for both foetus and mother to maintain an adequate asthma treatment during pregnancy. As with other drugs administered during pregnancy, the benefit of the administration of budesonide for the mother should be weighed against the risks to the foetus. Breastfeeding : Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses of budesonide no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. Budesonide can be used during breast feeding. Maintenance treatment with inhaled budesonide (200 or 400 micrograms twice daily) in asthmatic nursing women results in negligible systemic exposure to budesonide in breast-fed infants. In a pharmacokinetic study, the estimated daily infant dose was 0.3% of the daily maternal dose for both dose levels, and the average plasma concentration in infants was estimated to be 1/600th of the concentrations observed in maternal plasma, assuming complete infant oral bioavailability. Budesonide concentrations in infant plasma samples were all less than the limit of quantification. Based on data from inhaled budesonide and the fact that budesonide exhibits linear PK properties within the therapeutic dosage intervals after nasal, inhaled, oral and rectal administrations, at therapeutic doses of budesonide, exposure to the suckling child is anticipated to be low.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "The transfer of patients treated with oral corticosteroids to the inhaled corticosteroid and their subsequent management requires special care. The patients should be in a reasonably stable state before initiating a high dose of inhaled corticosteroid in addition to their usual maintenance dose of systemic corticosteroid. After about 10 days, withdrawal of the systemic corticosteroid is started by reducing the daily dose gradually (by for example 2.5 milligrams prednisolone or the equivalent each month) to the lowest possible level. It may be possible to completely replace the oral corticosteroid with inhaled corticosteroid. Transferred patients whose adrenocortical function is impaired may need supplementary systemic corticosteroid during periods of stress e.g. surgery, infection or worsening asthma attacks. Patients who have required high dose emergency corticosteroid therapy or prolonged treatment at the highest recommended dose of inhaled corticosteroids, may also be at risk of impaired adrenal function. These patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to severe stress. Additional systemic corticosteroid treatment should be considered during periods of stress or elective surgery. During transfer from oral therapy to inhaled Aeronid, symptoms may appear that had previously been suppressed by systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids, for example symptoms of allergic rhinitis, eczema, muscle and joint pain. Specific treatment should be co-administered to treat these conditions. Some patients may feel unwell in a non-specific way during the withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids despite maintenance or even improvement in respiratory function. Such patients should be encouraged to continue treatment with inhaled Aeronid and withdrawal of oral corticosteroid unless there are clinical signs to indicate the contrary, for example signs which might indicate adrenal insufficiency. As with other inhalation therapies paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, manifested by an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. Paradoxical bronchospasm responds to a rapid-acting inhaled bronchodilator and should be treated straight away. Aeronid should be discontinued immediately, the patient should be assessed and, if necessary, alternative treatment instituted. When an acute episode of dyspnoea occurs despite a well monitored treatment, a rapid-acting inhaled bronchodilator should be used and medical reassessment should be considered. If despite maximum doses of inhaled corticosteroids, asthma symptoms are not adequately controlled, patients may require short-term treatment with systemic corticosteroids. In such cases, it is necessary to maintain the inhaled corticosteroid therapy in association with treatment by the systemic route. Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods. These effects are much less likely to occur with inhalation treatment than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects include Cushing’s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract, glaucoma and more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children). It is important, therefore, that the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained. Influence on growth: It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. If growth is slowed, therapy should be re-evaluated with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The benefits of the corticosteroid therapy and the possible risks of growth suppression must be carefully weighed. In addition, consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist. Patients who have previously been dependent on oral corticosteroids may, as a result of prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy, experience effects of impaired adrenal function. Recovery may take a considerable amount of time after cessation of oral corticosteroid therapy and hence oral steroid-dependent patients transferred to Aeronid may remain at risk from impaired adrenocortical function for some considerable time. In such circumstances hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis function should be monitored regularly. Oral candidiasis may occur during the therapy with inhaled corticosteroids. This infection may require treatment with appropriate antifungal therapy and in some patients discontinuation of treatment may be necessary Exacerbation of clinical symptoms of asthma may be due to acute respiratory tract bacterial infections and treatment with appropriate antibiotics may be required. Such patients may need to increase the dose of inhaled Aeronid and a short course of oral corticosteroids may be required. A rapid-acting inhaled bronchodilator should be used as “rescue” medication to relieve acute asthma symptoms. Special care and adequate specific therapeutic control of patients with active and quiescent pulmonary tuberculosis is necessary before commencing treatment with inhaled Aeronid. Similarly patients with fungal, viral or other infections of the airways require close observation and special care and should use Aeronid only if they are also receiving adequate treatment for such infections. In patients with excessive mucous secretion in the respiratory tract, short-term therapy with oral corticosteroids may be necessary. In patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, treatment with inhaled Aeronid can result in a reduced elimination rate and hence enhanced systemic availability. Possible systemic effects may then result and therefore HPA axis function in these patients should be monitored at regular intervals. Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole, HIV protease inhibitors or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided. If this is not possible the time interval between administration of the two drugs should be as long as possible. Recent epidemiological studies show that there is an increased incidence of pneumonia in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) treated with inhaled corticosteroids, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.7. Care should be exercised in prescribing Aeronid for those patients whose respiratory disease might have a component of COPD. Visual disturbance: Visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical corticosteroids. Aeronid Nebuliser Suspension should be used with a jet Nebuliser device. An ultrasonic Nebuliser should not be used as this is not appropriate for Nebuliser suspensions.",
        "overdose_effects": "Symptoms: Acute overdose with Aeronid usually does not constitute a clinical problem. The only harmful effect after a large amount of sprays during a short period is a suppression of the cortex function. If it is a matter of chronic use of very high doses, effects such as a degree of cortex atrophy in addition to adrenocortical suppression may occur. Acute overdosage : There is no need for acute measures. The treatment with Aeronid should be continued with the lowest possible effective maintenance dose, and the adrenocortical function will repair itself automatically within 1-2 days. Chronic overdosage : The patient should be treated as a steroid dependent and be transferred to a suitable maintenance dose with a systemic steroid, for example prednisolone. When the condition is stabilized, the patient should continue the treatment with the inhalation of Aeronid at the recommended dose."

It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms. Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI) : e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis. Urinary Tract Infections : e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. Afixime is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.",

It is bactericidal against a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria at easily achievable plasma concentrations. It kills bacteria by interfering in the synthesis of bacterial cell wall. It is highly stable in the presence of Beta-lactamase enzyme. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalsporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to Cefixime. Absorption of it is about 40% to 50% whether administered with or without food.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Absorption of Cefixime is not significantly modified by the presence of food. The usual course of treatment is 7 days.

Adults and children over 10 years : The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. Elderly : Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. Children : The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: 6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily In typhoid : the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years : Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. Children aged less than 6 months : The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months. Dosage in Renal Impairment : Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded.

All itching skin conditions, including neurodermatitis, eczema of any origin, lichen planus, acute and chronic urticaria, pruritis of the anus or genitals, pruritus in icterus and diabetes, radiation sickness etc. Prevention and treatment of motion sickness. Prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting and vertigo due to Meniere’s disease and other labyrinthine disturbances.",
        "pharmacology": "Pheniramine competes with histamine for the histamine H1 receptor, acting as an inverse agonist once bound. The reduction in H1 receptor activity is responsible for reduced itching as well as reduced vasodilation and capillary leakage leading to less redness and edema. This can be seen in the suppression of the histamine-induced wheal (swelling) and flare (vasodilation) response. Inverse agonism of the H1 receptor in the CNS is also responsible for the sedation produced by first-generation antihistamines like pheniramine. The binding of pheniramine to H4 receptors, and subsequent inverse agonism, may also contribute to reduced itching by antagonizing inflammation.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Doses must be individually determined in all cases and should be taken with or soon after food. Treatment should be commenced at the lowest possible dose because experience has shown that antihistamines are often effective at low doses. The maximum dose of 3 mg/kg per day should not be exceeded. Elderly patients should use the adult dose with caution. To prevent travel sickness, it is recommended that the first dose be taken at least 30 minutes before traveling. Due to the risk of drowsiness, the patient should not drive a motor vehicle or operate machinery after taking a dose. Pheniramine Maleate tablets: In adults and children over 10 years of age : Treatment is commenced with half a tablet taken up to three times daily. This dose may be increased to one tablet taken up to three times daily if required. Children 5-10 years of age : Half a tablet up to three times daily.

Both the dosage and the time of administration should be carefully considered in patients whose activities (e.g. driving a car or operating machinery) demand special concentration. Patients should be cautioned against the simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and other central nervous system depressants. Aerovil may possibly be hallucinogenic in toxic doses. Due to the possible CNS stimulating effects of antihistamines, pheniramine has the potential for abuse. Due to the anticholinergic effect of pheniramine, caution and close monitoring are required if it is used in patients with conditions such as prostatic hypertrophy, narrow angle glaucoma, asthma or severe cardiovascular disease. The anti-emetic effect of pheniramine may mask the signs of other conditions. Products containing pheniramine should not be taken on an empty stomach.",
        "overdose_effects": "Symptoms : Antihistamine drugs in toxic doses produce a complex of CNS excitatory and depressant effects. Accidental ingestion in small children has resulted in convulsions and sometimes death. Management : As there is no specific antidote, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Induction of vomiting should only be used immediately after ingestion as the sedative action of any absorbed antihistamine can lead to life-threatening pulmonary aspiration during emesis. Gastric lavage with a cuffed endotracheal tube in situ may be useful for some time after ingestion of antihistamines as their anticholinergic action slows down gastric emptying. Stimulants should not be used as they may precipitate convulsions. Diazepam or short-acting barbiturates may be used to control convulsions. Vasopressors may be used to treat hypotension. Mechanical support of respiration may be required if respiration is seriously depressed. Continuous ECG monitoring is recommended if cardiac toxicity develops, which can be treated with centrally-acting anticholinesterases such as physostigmine."

Previously Treated, Metastatic Squamous NSCLC : Afatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC progressing after platinum-based chemotherapy.",
        "pharmacology": "Afatinib covalently binds to the kinase domains of EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), and HER4 (ErbB4) and irreversibly inhibits tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation, resulting in downregulation of ErbB signaling. Certain mutations in EGFR, including non-resistant mutations in its kinase domain, can result in increased autophosphorylation of the receptor, leading to receptor activation, sometimes in the absence of ligand binding, and can support cell proliferation in NSCLC. Non-resistant mutations are defined as those occurring in exons constituting the kinase domain of EGFR that lead to increased receptor activation and where efficacy is predicted by 1) clinically meaningful tumor shrinkage with the recommended dose of afatinib and/or 2) inhibition of cellular proliferation or EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation at concentrations of afatinib sustainable at the recommended dosage according to validated methods. The most commonly found of these mutations are exon 21 L858R substitutions and exon 19 deletions. Afatinib demonstrated inhibition of autophosphorylation and/or in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing wild type EGFR and in those expressing selected EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, exon 21 L858R mutations, or other less common non-resistant mutations, at afatinib concentrations achieved in patients. In addition, afatinib inhibited in vitro proliferation of cell lines overexpressing HER2. Treatment with afatinib resulted in inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice implanted with tumors either overexpressing wild type EGFR or HER2 or in an EGFR L858R/T790M double mutant model.",

Periodic liver testing should be obtained in patients during treatment with Afatin. Afatin should be withheld in patients who develop worsening of liver function. In patients who develop severe hepatic impairment while taking Afatin, treatment should be discontinued. Keratitis : Keratitis, characterized as acute or worsening eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain, and/or red eye occurred in 0.7% of patients treated with Afatin among 4257 patients across clinical trials, of which 0.05% of patients experienced Grade 3 keratitis. Keratitis was reported in 2.2% patients in Study 1, with Grade 3 in 0.4%. Afatin should be withheld during evaluation of patients with suspected keratitis, and if diagnosis of ulcerative keratitis is confirmed, treatment with Afatin should be interrupted or discontinued. If keratitis is diagnosed, the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be carefully considered. Afatin should be used with caution in patients with a history of keratitis, ulcerative keratitis, or severe dry eye. Contact lens use is also a risk factor for keratitis and ulceration.",

Read more Antioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows: β carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with β carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",
        "pharmacology": "Beta carotene of this tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity. Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption. vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.",

This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids. Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation. Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.",

        "strength": "100 mg",
        "unit_price": "৳ 50.00",
        "indications": "Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Aggra to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Aggra is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.",
        "pharmacology": "Mechanism of Action : The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours. Absorption and Distribution : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced. Metabolism and Excretion : Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose). Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations : Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Erectile dysfunction : For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day. The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil : age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose. Pulmonary arterial hypertension : The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.",
        "contraindications": "Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.",

Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of Aggra without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of Aggra and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to Aggra, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying 23 cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors.

        "precautions_and_warnings": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Aggra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Aggra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs. Aggra has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications. Patients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Aggra. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Aggra, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted. The safety of Aggra is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration. Aggra should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). The safety and efficacy of combinations of Aggra with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended. There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Aggra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Aggra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Aggra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Aggra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Aggra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months; Patients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110); Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina; Patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases); Patients with sickle cell or related anemias. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Aggra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Aggra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Aggra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Aggra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Aggra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Aggra dosage is recommended.",
        "overdose_effects": "In studies with healthy volunteers of single doses up to 800 mg, adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses but incidence rates and severities were increased. 24 In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as Aggra is highly bound to plasma proteins and it is not eliminated in the urine."

        "contraindications": "Fluconazole should not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to Fluconazole or to related triazole compounds.",
        "side_effects": "Afluzole is generally well tolerated. The commonest side-efects associated Afluzole are symptoms associated with the gastrointestinal tract; these include nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and fatulence. Other adverse events such as rash are rarely encountered (Incidence less than 1%). In rare cases, as with other azoles, anaphylaxis has been reported.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Fluconazole adverse fetal efects have been seen in animals only at dose levels associated with maternal toxicity. These levels are many times in excess of those recommended for therapeutic use. There has been little use during human pregnancy. Accordingly, fuconazole should not be used in pregnancy or in women of child bearing potential unless adequate contraception is employed.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "in some patients, particularly those with serious underlying diseases such as AIDS and cancer, abnormalities of hepatic, renal, haematological and other biochemical function tests have been observed during treatment with fuconazole, but the clinical signifcance and relationship to treatment is uncertain. Very rarely. patients who died with severe underlying disease and who had received multiple dose fuconazole, had post-mortem fndings which included hapatic necrosis. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs. Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop. Use during lactation: Afluzole is found in human breast milk at concentrations similar to plasma. hence its use in nursing mothers is not recommended. Driving/Use of machinery: Experience with fuconazole indicates that therapy a unlikely to impair a patient's ability to drive or use machinery.",
        "overdose_effects": "In the event of overdosage, supportive measures and symptomatic treatment with gastric lavage if necessary may be adequate. As fuconazole is excreted largely in the urine, forced volume diuresis would probably increase the elimination rate. A three hour session of haemodialysis decreases plasma levels by approximately 50%"

        "pharmacology": "Albendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activities. The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A2. Dipyridamole inhibits platelet aggregation by inhibiting the uptake of adenosine into platelet, which is a potent mediator of vasodilation. Dipyridamole increases local concentration of adenosine which increases cAMP (cyclic-adenosine monophosphate) level thus decreased ca ++ concentration and inhibits platelet aggregation. Dipyridamole also inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) especially cyclic-guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP-PDE), which increases cGMP produced by EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor) Nitric oxide a potent vasodilator.",

        "pharmacology": "Clotrimazole acts primarily by damaging the permeability barrier in the cell membrane of fungi. Clotrimazole causes inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, an essential constituent of fungal cell membranes. If ergosterol synthesis is either completely or partially inhibited, the cell is no longer able to construct an intact and functional cell membrane. Because ergosterol directly promotes the growth of fungal cells in a hormone‐like fashion, rapid onset of the above events leads to dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth. Though decreased ergosterol, due to the inhibition of lanosterol 14-demethylase (also known as CYP51) is accepted to be primarily responsible for the antimycotic properties of clotrimazole, this drug also shows other pharmacological effects. These include the inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase, depletion of intracellular calcium, and blocking of calcium‐dependent potassium channels and voltage‐dependent calcium channels. The action of clotrimazole on these targets accounts for other effects of this drug that are separate from its antimycotic activities.",

Very rarely. patients who died with severe underlying disease and who had received multiple dose fuconazole, had post-mortem fndings which included hapatic necrosis. These patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications, some known to be potentially hepatotoxic, and/or had underlying diseases, which could have caused the hepatic necrosis. Consequently, because a causal relationship with fuconazole cannot be excluded, the risk-beneft ratio of continued fuconazole treatment should be assessed in those patients in whom a signifcant rise of liver enzymes occurs. Patients have rarely developed exfoliative cutaneous reactions, such pa Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, during treatment with fuconazole. AIDS patients are more prone to the development of severe cutaneous reactions to many drugs. If a rash develops in a patients treated for a superfaclal fungal infection which is considered attributable to fuconazole further therapy with this agent should be discontinued. In patients with invasive/ systemic fungal infections who develop rashes, they should be monitored closely and fuconazole should be discontinued if bolbous lesions or erythema multiform develop. Use during lactation: Afluzole is found in human breast milk at concentrations similar to plasma. hence its use in nursing mothers is not recommended. Driving/Use of machinery: Experience with fuconazole indicates that therapy a unlikely to impair a patient's ability to drive or use machinery.",

        "indications": "Treatment of men with erectile dysfunction, which is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. In order for Aggra to be effective, sexual stimulation is required. Aggra is also indicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension.",
        "pharmacology": "Mechanism of Action : The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum, but enhances the effect of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by Sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly cytochrome P450 3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, Sildenafil. Both Sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours. Absorption and Distribution : Sildenafil is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When Sildenafil is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced. Metabolism and Excretion : Sildenafil is cleared by hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. After either oral or intravenous administration, Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose). Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations : Geriatrics: Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of Sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of Sildenafil compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Erectile dysfunction : For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Sildenafil may be taken anywhere from 4 hours to 0.5 hour before sexual activity. Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day. The following factors are associated with increased plasma levels of Sildenafil : age >65, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, and concomitant use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, saquinavir). Since higher plasma levels may increase both the efficacy and incidence of adverse events, a starting dose of 25 mg should be considered in these patients. Sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors or nitrates in any form is therefore contraindicated. When Sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alphablocker therapy prior to initiating Sildenafil treatment and Sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose. Pulmonary arterial hypertension : The recommended dose of sildenafil citrate is 20 mg three times a day and should be taken approximately 4-6 hours apart, with or without food.",
        "contraindications": "Sildenafil is contraindicated in patient with hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, so it is contraindicated in patients who are using organic nitrates, either regularly or intermittently.",

        "precautions_and_warnings": "General: The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment. Before prescribing Aggra, it is important to note the following: Caution is advised when Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including Aggra, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g. dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose. In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. A stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs. Aggra has systemic vasodilatory properties and may augment the blood pressure-lowering effect of other anti-hypertensive medications. Patients on multiple antihypertensive medications were included in the pivotal clinical trials for Aggra. In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and Aggra, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted. The safety of Aggra is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration. Aggra should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). The safety and efficacy of combinations of Aggra with other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended. There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including Aggra, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. Aggra has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg). While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing Aggra, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity. Patients with the following underlying conditions can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including Aggra - those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g. aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure. There is no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of Aggra in the following groups; if prescribed, this should be done with caution. Patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia within the last 6 months; Patients with resting hypotension (BP <90/50) or hypertension (BP >170/110); Patients with cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina; Patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases); Patients with sickle cell or related anemias. Prolonged erection greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) have been reported infrequently since market approval of Aggra. In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. If Aggra is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of Aggra are limited. Visual disturbances occurred more commonly at higher levels of Aggra exposure. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of Aggra (200-800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse events in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in Aggra dosage is recommended.",
        "overdose_effects": "In studies with healthy volunteers of single doses up to 800 mg, adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses but incidence rates and severities were increased. 24 In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance as Aggra is highly bound to plasma proteins and it is not eliminated in the urine."

Read more Antioxidant vitamins are used in a wide range of conditions where free radical damage is playing a role. Antioxidant vitamin combination is used in the prevention of coronary heart diseases, certain types of cancer, aging as well as free radical damage caused by excessive exercise, illness, certain medications, air pollution, smoke, radiation and pesticides. The main role of the antioxidant vitamins is as follows: β carotene prevents free radical formation by quenching singlet oxygen, a highly reactive form of oxygen. Vitamin C is another free radical scavenger which deactivates free radicals. It works specially in the plasma, lung fluid, aqueous humour and interstitial fluid. It can increase white blood cell activity; play important roles in the biochemistry of antibodies, prostaglandin E 1 , B and T lymphocytes, and interferon. Vitamin E also scavenges free radicals in the blood along with β carotene and vitamin C. Moreover, vitamin E is essential to protect against some of the ill effects of smog and smoke. In relation to other nutrients vitamin E protects vitamin A from being destroyed in the body.",
        "pharmacology": "Beta carotene of this tablet is converted to vitamin A (Retinol) when required. Retinol has several biochemical functions e.g. on retina, growth, tissue differentiation, immunological response. It has also some anti-cancer activity. Vitamin C is the most powerful reducing agent known to be present in living tissues. Vitamin C deficiency produces scurvy. It is a cofactor in numerous biological processes. Vitamin C and molecular oxygen are essential for the conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, dopamine to noradrenaline . Vitamin C is also essential for the synthesis of adrenal steroid hormones. Vitamin C is important in the defense against infection and studies shown that vitamin C is important for the normal functioning of T-lymphocyte and leukocyte. Ascorbic acid has some antiinflammatory activity and protects cells against oxidation of essential molecules. In high doses, (1-2 g daily) ascorbic acid increases iron absorption. vitamin E seems to be as a defense against oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In most cell membranes there is one molecule of tocopherol for every 1000 lipid molecules. Tocopherol mops up peroxide radicals and then needs a supply of reduced hydrogen to restore the steady-state situation. This is usually supplied by ascorbic acid or reduced glutathione.",

        "side_effects": "β carotene is comparatively safe even at high and prolonged exposure. Individuals who routinely ingest large amounts of carotenoids can develop hypercarotenosis, which is characterised by a yellowish colouration of the skin and a very high concentration of carotenoids in the plasma. This benign condition, although resembling jaundice, gradually disappears upon correcting the excessive intake of carotenoids. Vitamin C is generally a safe drug for human use in normal doses. Larger doses may lead to gastrointestinal tract upset and renal stone formation. Vitamin E is considered safe even in large doses. Doses over 800 mg may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain or cramps, fatigue and reduced resistance to bacterial infection and transiently raised blood pressure.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "β carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E have no teratogenic effects in humans. However, like any other drugs caution should be taken in prescribing to pregnant women.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "There are some evidences that β carotene may cause harm to heavy smokers and alcoholics. Therefore, caution should be exercised in these cases. Vitamin C should be given with caution to patients with hyperoxaluria.

Thus vitamin C helps in faster recovery after surgery or any other trauma. Vitamin C quenches free radicals in the water based cellular components and thus acts as an antioxidant. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, which is stored in the liver, adipose tissues, heart, muscles etc. It is an active antioxidant, which prevents oxidation of fat compounds. It works in synergy with Selenium. Vitamin K is a key anti-aging vitamin and it prevents heart disease and osteoporosis. Zinc is an important mineral that can actually rejuvenate the shrinking thymus gland that involves the working of the immune system. Zinc is a co-factor in over 100 enzymes of the body. Selenium: Apart from being a co-factor in antioxidant enzymes, Selenium by itself has potent antioxidant capabilities. So, it prevents aging and hardening of tissues through oxidation. Vitamin E and Selenium are synergistic and seem to potentiate each other's antioxidant activities. Copper is an important co-factor of a number of enzymes present in our body.

        "pharmacology": "Isotretinoin produces its effects through altering progress through the cell cycle, cell differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. These actions reduce sebum production, preventing the blockage of pores, and growth of acne causing bacteria. Isotretinoin and 4-oxo-isotretinoin both significantly reduce the production of sebum. Isotretinoin has little to no affinity for retinol binding proteins (RBPs) and retinoic acid nuclear receptors (RARs). Tretinoin and 4-oxo-tretinion bind to the RAR-γ receptor, which is suspected to be part of the action of acne treatment by isotretinoin. Isotretinoin induces apoptosis in sebocytes, leading to a decrease in sebum production. Isotretinoin also reduces the formation of comedones by reducing hyperkeratinization through an unknown mechanism. Isotretinoin does not directly kill bacteria but it does reduce the size of sebum ducts and makes the microenvironment less hospitable to acne causing bacteria. It may also increase immune mechanisms and alter chemotaxis of monocytes to reduce inflammation.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "The capsules should be taken with food once or twice daily. Isotretinoin should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of physicians with expertise in the use of systemic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of Isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements. Adults including adolescents and the elderly : Isotretinoin therapy should be started at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg daily. The therapeutic response to Isotretinoin and some of the adverse effects are dose-related and vary between patients. This necessitates individual dosage adjustment during therapy. For most patients, the dose ranges from 0.5-1.0 mg/kg per day. Long-term remission and relapse rates are more closely related to the total dose administered than to either duration of treatment or daily dose. It has been shown that no substantial additional benefit is to be expected beyond a cumulative treatment dose of 120-150 mg/kg. The duration of treatment will depend on the individual daily dose. A treatment course of 16-24 weeks is normally sufficient to achieve remission. In the majority of patients, complete clearing of the acne is obtained with a single treatment course. In the event of a definite relapse a further course of Isotretinoin therapy may be considered using the same daily dose and cumulative treatment dose. As further improvement of the acne can be observed up to 8 weeks after discontinuation of treatment, a further course of treatment should not be considered until at least this period has elapsed. Patients with severe renal insufficiency : In patients with severe renal insufficiency treatment should be started at a lower dose (e.g. 10 mg/day). The dose should then be increased up to 1 mg/kg/day or until the patient is receiving the maximum tolerated dose. Children : Isotretinoin is not indicated for the treatment of prepubertal acne and is not recommended in patients less than 12 years of age due to a lack of data on efficacy and safety. Patients with intolerance : In patients who show severe intolerance to the recommended dose, treatment may be continued at a lower dose with the consequences of a longer therapy duration and a higher risk of relapse. In order to achieve the maximum possible efficacy in these patients the dose should normally be continued at the highest tolerated dose.",
        "contraindications": "Isotretinoin is contraindicated in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Isotretinoin is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential unless all of the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme are met.

Isotretinoin is also contraindicated in patients with hepatic insufficiency, with excessively elevated blood lipid values, with hypervitaminosis A, receiving concomitant treatment with tetracyclines. This medicinal product is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential unless all of the following conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme are met: She has severe acne (such as nodular or conglobate acne or acne at risk of permanent scarring) resistant to adequate courses of standard therapy with systemic anti-bacterials and topical therapy. She understands the teratogenic risk. She understands the need for rigorous follow-up, on a monthly basis. She understands and accepts the need for effective contraception, without interruption, 1 month before starting treatment, throughout the duration of treatment and 1 month after the end of treatment. At least one and preferably two complementary forms of contraception including a barrier method should be used. Even if she has amenorrhea she must follow all of the advice on effective contraception. She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures.

She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing before, during and 5 weeks after the end of treatment. She has acknowledged that she has understood the hazards and necessary precautions associated with the use of Isotretinoin. These conditions also concern women who are not currently sexually active unless the prescriber considers that there are compelling reasons to indicate that there is no risk of pregnancy. The prescriber must ensure that the patient complies with the conditions for pregnancy prevention as listed above, including confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding. The patient has acknowledged the aforementioned conditions. The patient has used at least one and preferably two methods of effective contraception including a barrier method for at least 1 month prior to starting treatment and is continuing to use effective contraception throughout the treatment period and for at least 1 month after cessation of treatment. Negative pregnancy test results have been obtained before, during and 5 weeks after the end of treatment. The dates and results of pregnancy tests should be documented.",
        "side_effects": "Some of the side effects associated with the use of Akno are dose-related. The side effects are generally reversible after altering the dose or discontinuation of treatment, however some may persist after treatment has stopped. The following symptoms are the most commonly reported undesirable effects with Akno: dryness of the skin, dryness of the mucosae e.g. of the lips (cheilitis), the nasal mucosa (epistaxis) and the eyes (conjunctivitis). The incidence of the adverse events was calculated from pooled clinical trial data involving 824 patients and from post-marketing data.

Renal and urinary disorders: Very Rare: Glomerulonephritis. General disorders and administration site conditions: Very Rare: Granulation tissue (increased formation of), malaise. Overdose Akno is a derivative of vitamin A. Although the acute toxicity of Akno is low, signs of hypervitaminosis A could appear in cases of accidental overdose. Manifestations of acute vitamin A toxicity include severe headache, nausea or vomiting, drowsiness, irritability and pruritus. Signs and symptoms of accidental or deliberate overdosage with Akno would probably be similar. These symptoms would be expected to be reversible and to subside without the need for treatment. Pharmaceutical precautions Store in a cool and dry place protected from light.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to treatment with Isotretinoin. If pregnancy does occur in spite of these precautions during treatment with Isotretinoin or in the month following, there is a great risk of very severe and serious malformation of the foetus. The foetal malformations associated with exposure to Isotretinoin include central nervous system abnormalities (hydrocephalus, cerebellar malformation/abnormalities, microcephaly), facial dysmorphia, cleft palate, external ear abnormalities (absence of external ear, small or absent external auditory canals), eye abnormalities (microphthalmia), cardiovascular abnormalities (conotruncal malformations such as tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of great vessels, septal defects), thymus gland abnormality and parathyroid gland abnormalities. There is also an increased incidence of spontaneous abortion. If pregnancy occurs in a woman treated with Isotretinoin, treatment must be stopped and the patient should be referred to a physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. Isotretinoin is highly lipophilic, therefore the passage of Isotretinoin into human milk is very likely. Due to the potential for adverse effects in the child exposed via mothers’ milk, the use of Isotretinoin is contraindicated in nursing mothers.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Contraception : Female patients must be provided with comprehensive information on pregnancy prevention and should be referred for contraceptive advice if they are not using effective contraception. As a minimum requirement, female patients at potential risk of pregnancy must use at least one effective method of contraception. Preferably the patient should use two complementary forms of contraception including a barrier method. Contraception should be continued for at least 1 month after stopping treatment with Akno, even in patients with amenorrhea. Pregnancy testing : According to local practice, medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 25mIU/mL are recommended to be performed in the first 3 days of the menstrual cycle, as follows. Prior to starting therapy : In order to exclude the possibility of pregnancy prior to starting contraception, it is recommended that an initial medically supervised pregnancy test should be performed and its date and result recorded. In patients without regular menses, the timing of this pregnancy test should reflect the sexual activity of the patient and should be undertaken approximately 3 weeks after the patient last had unprotected sexual intercourse. The prescriber should educate the patient about contraception. A medically supervised pregnancy test should also be performed during the consultation when Akno is prescribed or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber, and should have been delayed until the patient had been using effective contraception for at least 1 month. This test should ensure the patient is not pregnant when she starts treatment with Akno. Follow-up visits : Follow-up visits should be arranged at 28 day intervals. The need for repeated medically supervised pregnancy tests every month should be determined according to local practice including consideration of the patient’s sexual activity and recent menstrual history (abnormal menses, missed periods or amenorrhea). Where indicated, follow-up pregnancy tests should be performed on the day of the prescribing visit or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber. End of treatment : Five weeks after stopping treatment, women should undergo a final pregnancy test to exclude pregnancy. Prescribing and dispensing restrictions : Prescriptions of Akno for women of childbearing potential should be limited to 30 days of treatment and continuation of treatment requires a new prescription. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and dispensing of Akno should occur on the same day. Dispensing of Akno should occur within a maximum of 7 days of the prescription. Male patients : The available data suggest that the level of maternal exposure from the semen of the patients receiving Akno, is not of a sufficient magnitude to be associated with the teratogenic effects of Akno. Male patients should be reminded that they must not share their medication with anyone, particularly not females. Additional precautions : Patients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person, and to return any unused capsules to their pharmacist at the end of treatment. Patients should not donate blood during therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation of Akno because of the potential risk to the foetus of a pregnant transfusion recipient. Psychiatric disorders : Depression, depression aggravated, anxiety, aggressive tendencies, mood alterations, psychotic symptoms, and very rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and suicide have been reported in patients treated with Akno. Particular care needs to be taken in patients with a history of depression and all patients should be monitored for signs of depression and referred for appropriate treatment if necessary. However, discontinuation of Akno may be insufficient to alleviate symptoms and therefore further psychiatric or psychological evaluation may be necessary. Skin and subcutaneous tissues disorders : Acute exacerbation of acne is occasionally seen during the initial period but this subsides with continued treatment, usually within 7-10 days, and usually does not require dose adjustment. Exposure to intense sunlight or to UV rays should be avoided. Where necessary a sun-protection product with a high protection factor of at least SPF 15 should be used. Aggressive chemical dermabrasion and cutaneous laser treatment should be avoided in patients on Akno for a period of 5-6 months after the end of the treatment because of the risk of hypertrophic scarring in atypical areas and more rarely post inflammatory hyper or hypopigmentation in treated areas. Wax depilation should be avoided in patients on Akno for at least a period of 6 months after treatment because of the risk of epidermal stripping. Concurrent administration of Akno with topical keratolytic or exfoliative anti-acne agents should be avoided as local irritation may increase. Patients should be advised to use a skin moisturising ointment or cream and a lip balm from the start of treatment as Akno is likely to cause dryness of the skin and lips. There have been post-marketing reports of severe skin reactions (e.g. erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)) associated with Akno use. As these events may be difficult to distinguish from other skin reactions that may occur, patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for severe skin reactions. If a severe skin reaction is suspected, Akno treatment should be discontinued. Allergic reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been rarely reported, in some cases after previous topical exposure to retinoids. Allergic cutaneous reactions are reported infrequently. Serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement have been reported. Severe allergic reactions necessitate interruption of therapy and careful monitoring. Eye disorders : Dry eyes, corneal opacities, decreased night vision and keratitis usually resolve after discontinuation of therapy. Dry eyes can be helped by the application of a lubricating eye ointment or by the application of tear replacement therapy. Intolerance to contact lenses may occur which may necessitate the patient to wear glasses during treatment. Decreased night vision has also been reported and the onset in some patients was sudden. Withdrawal of Akno may be necessary. Musculo-skeletal and connective tissue disorders : Myalgia, arthralgia and increased serum creatine phosphokinase values have been reported in patients receiving Akno, particularly in those undertaking vigorous physical activity. Bone changes including premature epiphyseal closure, hyperostosis, and calcification of tendons and ligaments have occurred after several years of administration at very high doses for treating disorders of keratinisation. The dose levels, duration of treatment and total cumulative dose in these patients generally far exceeded those recommended for the treatment of acne. Benign intracranial hypertension : Cases of benign intracranial hypertension have been reported, some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Signs and symptoms of benign intracranial hypertension include headache, nausea and vomiting, visual disturbances and papilloedema. Patients who develop benign intracranial hypertension should discontinue Akno immediately. Hepatobiliary disorders : Liver enzymes should be checked before treatment, 1 month after the start of treatment, and subsequently at 3 monthly intervals unless more frequent monitoring is clinically indicated. Transient and reversible increases in liver transaminases have been reported. In many cases these changes have been within the normal range and values have returned to baseline levels during treatment. However, in the event of persistent clinically relevant elevation of transaminase levels, reduction of the dose or discontinuation of treatment should be considered. Renal insufficiency : Renal insufficiency and renal failure do not affect the pharmacokinetics of Akno. Therefore, Akno can be given to patients with renal insufficiency. However, it is recommended that patients are started on a low dose and titrated up to the maximum tolerated dose. Lipid Metabolism : Serum lipids (fasting values) should be checked before treatment, 1 month after the start of treatment, and subsequently at 3 monthly intervals unless more frequent monitoring is clinically indicated. Elevated serum lipid values usually return to normal on reduction of the dose or discontinuation of treatment and may also respond to dietary measures. Akno has been associated with an increase in plasma triglyceride levels. Akno should be discontinued if hypertriglyceridaemia cannot be controlled at an acceptable level or if symptoms of pancreatitis occur. Levels in excess of 800mg/dL or 9mmol/L are sometimes associated with acute pancreatitis, which may be fatal. Gastrointestinal disorders : Akno has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. Patients experiencing severe (hemorrhagic) diarrhoea should discontinue Akno immediately. High Risk Patients : In patients with diabetes, obesity, alcoholism or a lipid metabolism disorder undergoing treatment with Akno, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids and/or blood glucose may be necessary. Elevated fasting blood sugars have been reported, and new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during Akno therapy.",

        "pharmacology": "Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter 2 (SGLT2). SGLT2 is the predominant transporter, responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the kidney back into the circulation. By inhibiting SGLT2, Empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion. Metformin Hydrochloride is a biguanide type oral antihyperglycemic drug, used in the management of type 2 diabetes. It lowers both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. It does not produce hypoglycemia. Metformin Hydrochloride decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and improves insulin sensitivity by an increase in peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "The dosage should be individualized based on effectiveness and tolerability. Take this combination twice daily with meals. Dose escalation should be gradual to reduce the gastrointestinal side effects due to Metformin Hydrochloride. Maximum recommended daily dose of Metformin Hydrochloride is 2000 mg and Empagliflozin is 25 mg. Recommended individualized starting dose : In patients on Metformin Hydrochloride, switch to this combination containing Empagliflozin 5 mg with a similar total daily dose of Metformin Hydrochloride. In patients on Empagliflozin, switch to this combination containing Metformin Hydrochloride 500 mg with a similar total daily dose of Empagliflozin. In patients already treated with Empagliflozin and Metformin Hydrochloride separately switch to this combination containing the same total daily doses of each component. In patients with volume depletion not previously treated with Empagliflozin, correct this condition before initiating this combination. Extended-release formulations : Individualize starting dose based on the patient’s current drug regimen. Take film coated tablet twice daily with meal and extended-release formulations should be taken once daily with meal, with gradual dose escalation to reduce the Gl adverse effects due to Metformin. Adjust dosing based on effectiveness and tolerability while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of Metformin Hydrochloride 2000 mg and Empagliflozin 25 mg. Renal impaired patient : Assess renal function before initiating this combination. In patients with an eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 is contraindicated.

Overdose in infants induced by nursing mothers has not been observed; however, when prescribing additional vitamin D3 to a breast-fed child the practitioner should consider the dose of any additional vitamin D3 given to the mother.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Plasma-calcium concentration should be monitored at intervals in patients receiving high doses of Vitamin D3, in renal impairment, and during pregnancy & lactation. People using Digoxin and Thiazide Diuretics should consult a health care practitioner before supplementing with Vitamin D3. People with liver or kidney disease, primary hyperthyroidism, lymphoma, tuberculosis and granulomatous disease should consult a health care practitioner before supplementing with Vitamin D3.",

The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC 4 , LTD 4 , LTE 4 ) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. Cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma & allergic rhinitis, including airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.",

        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Montelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast is given to a nursing mother.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Airup is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Airup can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Airup should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Airup should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Airup. Although Airup is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.",
        "overdose_effects": "There were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Airup and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required."

        "indications": "Aknill capsule is indicated in severe forms of acne (such as nodular or conglobate acne or acne at risk of permanent scarring) resistant to adequate courses of standard therapy with systemic antibacterials and topical therapy.",
        "pharmacology": "Isotretinoin produces its effects through altering progress through the cell cycle, cell differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. These actions reduce sebum production, preventing the blockage of pores, and growth of acne causing bacteria. Isotretinoin and 4-oxo-isotretinoin both significantly reduce the production of sebum. Isotretinoin has little to no affinity for retinol binding proteins (RBPs) and retinoic acid nuclear receptors (RARs). Tretinoin and 4-oxo-tretinion bind to the RAR-γ receptor, which is suspected to be part of the action of acne treatment by isotretinoin. Isotretinoin induces apoptosis in sebocytes, leading to a decrease in sebum production. Isotretinoin also reduces the formation of comedones by reducing hyperkeratinization through an unknown mechanism. Isotretinoin does not directly kill bacteria but it does reduce the size of sebum ducts and makes the microenvironment less hospitable to acne causing bacteria. It may also increase immune mechanisms and alter chemotaxis of monocytes to reduce inflammation.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "The capsules should be taken with food once or twice daily. Isotretinoin should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of physicians with expertise in the use of systemic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of Isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements. Adults including adolescents and the elderly : Isotretinoin therapy should be started at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg daily. The therapeutic response to Isotretinoin and some of the adverse effects are dose-related and vary between patients. This necessitates individual dosage adjustment during therapy. For most patients, the dose ranges from 0.5-1.0 mg/kg per day. Long-term remission and relapse rates are more closely related to the total dose administered than to either duration of treatment or daily dose. It has been shown that no substantial additional benefit is to be expected beyond a cumulative treatment dose of 120-150 mg/kg. The duration of treatment will depend on the individual daily dose. A treatment course of 16-24 weeks is normally sufficient to achieve remission. In the majority of patients, complete clearing of the acne is obtained with a single treatment course. In the event of a definite relapse a further course of Isotretinoin therapy may be considered using the same daily dose and cumulative treatment dose. As further improvement of the acne can be observed up to 8 weeks after discontinuation of treatment, a further course of treatment should not be considered until at least this period has elapsed. Patients with severe renal insufficiency : In patients with severe renal insufficiency treatment should be started at a lower dose (e.g. 10 mg/day). The dose should then be increased up to 1 mg/kg/day or until the patient is receiving the maximum tolerated dose. Children : Isotretinoin is not indicated for the treatment of prepubertal acne and is not recommended in patients less than 12 years of age due to a lack of data on efficacy and safety. Patients with intolerance : In patients who show severe intolerance to the recommended dose, treatment may be continued at a lower dose with the consequences of a longer therapy duration and a higher risk of relapse. In order to achieve the maximum possible efficacy in these patients the dose should normally be continued at the highest tolerated dose.",
        "contraindications": "Isotretinoin is contraindicated in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Isotretinoin is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential unless all of the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme are met. Isotretinoin is also contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to Isotretinoin or to any of the excipients. Isotretinoin is also contraindicated in patients with hepatic insufficiency, with excessively elevated blood lipid values, with hypervitaminosis A, receiving concomitant treatment with tetracyclines. This medicinal product is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential unless all of the following conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme are met: She has severe acne (such as nodular or conglobate acne or acne at risk of permanent scarring) resistant to adequate courses of standard therapy with systemic anti-bacterials and topical therapy. She understands the teratogenic risk. She understands the need for rigorous follow-up, on a monthly basis. She understands and accepts the need for effective contraception, without interruption, 1 month before starting treatment, throughout the duration of treatment and 1 month after the end of treatment. At least one and preferably two complementary forms of contraception including a barrier method should be used. Even if she has amenorrhea she must follow all of the advice on effective contraception. She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures. She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to rapidly consult if there is a risk of pregnancy. She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing before, during and 5 weeks after the end of treatment. She has acknowledged that she has understood the hazards and necessary precautions associated with the use of Isotretinoin. These conditions also concern women who are not currently sexually active unless the prescriber considers that there are compelling reasons to indicate that there is no risk of pregnancy. The prescriber must ensure that the patient complies with the conditions for pregnancy prevention as listed above, including confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding. The patient has acknowledged the aforementioned conditions. The patient has used at least one and preferably two methods of effective contraception including a barrier method for at least 1 month prior to starting treatment and is continuing to use effective contraception throughout the treatment period and for at least 1 month after cessation of treatment. Negative pregnancy test results have been obtained before, during and 5 weeks after the end of treatment. The dates and results of pregnancy tests should be documented.",
        "side_effects": "Some of the side effects associated with the use of Aknill are dose-related. The side effects are generally reversible after altering the dose or discontinuation of treatment, however some may persist after treatment has stopped. The following symptoms are the most commonly reported undesirable effects with Aknill: dryness of the skin, dryness of the mucosae e.g. of the lips (cheilitis), the nasal mucosa (epistaxis) and the eyes (conjunctivitis). The incidence of the adverse events was calculated from pooled clinical trial data involving 824 patients and from post-marketing data. Frequency categories are defined as Very common (³1/10), Common (³1/100 to <1/10), Uncommon (³1/1,000 to <1/100), Rare (³1/10,000 to <1/1,000), Very rare (³1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data.

Renal and urinary disorders: Very Rare: Glomerulonephritis. General disorders and administration site conditions: Very Rare: Granulation tissue (increased formation of), malaise. Overdose Aknill is a derivative of vitamin A. Although the acute toxicity of Aknill is low, signs of hypervitaminosis A could appear in cases of accidental overdose. Manifestations of acute vitamin A toxicity include severe headache, nausea or vomiting, drowsiness, irritability and pruritus. Signs and symptoms of accidental or deliberate overdosage with Aknill would probably be similar. These symptoms would be expected to be reversible and to subside without the need for treatment. Pharmaceutical precautions Store in a cool and dry place protected from light.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to treatment with Isotretinoin. If pregnancy does occur in spite of these precautions during treatment with Isotretinoin or in the month following, there is a great risk of very severe and serious malformation of the foetus. The foetal malformations associated with exposure to Isotretinoin include central nervous system abnormalities (hydrocephalus, cerebellar malformation/abnormalities, microcephaly), facial dysmorphia, cleft palate, external ear abnormalities (absence of external ear, small or absent external auditory canals), eye abnormalities (microphthalmia), cardiovascular abnormalities (conotruncal malformations such as tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of great vessels, septal defects), thymus gland abnormality and parathyroid gland abnormalities. There is also an increased incidence of spontaneous abortion. If pregnancy occurs in a woman treated with Isotretinoin, treatment must be stopped and the patient should be referred to a physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. Isotretinoin is highly lipophilic, therefore the passage of Isotretinoin into human milk is very likely. Due to the potential for adverse effects in the child exposed via mothers’ milk, the use of Isotretinoin is contraindicated in nursing mothers.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Contraception : Female patients must be provided with comprehensive information on pregnancy prevention and should be referred for contraceptive advice if they are not using effective contraception. As a minimum requirement, female patients at potential risk of pregnancy must use at least one effective method of contraception. Preferably the patient should use two complementary forms of contraception including a barrier method. Contraception should be continued for at least 1 month after stopping treatment with Aknill, even in patients with amenorrhea. Pregnancy testing : According to local practice, medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 25mIU/mL are recommended to be performed in the first 3 days of the menstrual cycle, as follows. Prior to starting therapy : In order to exclude the possibility of pregnancy prior to starting contraception, it is recommended that an initial medically supervised pregnancy test should be performed and its date and result recorded. In patients without regular menses, the timing of this pregnancy test should reflect the sexual activity of the patient and should be undertaken approximately 3 weeks after the patient last had unprotected sexual intercourse. The prescriber should educate the patient about contraception. A medically supervised pregnancy test should also be performed during the consultation when Aknill is prescribed or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber, and should have been delayed until the patient had been using effective contraception for at least 1 month. This test should ensure the patient is not pregnant when she starts treatment with Aknill. Follow-up visits : Follow-up visits should be arranged at 28 day intervals. The need for repeated medically supervised pregnancy tests every month should be determined according to local practice including consideration of the patient’s sexual activity and recent menstrual history (abnormal menses, missed periods or amenorrhea). Where indicated, follow-up pregnancy tests should be performed on the day of the prescribing visit or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber. End of treatment : Five weeks after stopping treatment, women should undergo a final pregnancy test to exclude pregnancy. Prescribing and dispensing restrictions : Prescriptions of Aknill for women of childbearing potential should be limited to 30 days of treatment and continuation of treatment requires a new prescription. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and dispensing of Aknill should occur on the same day. Dispensing of Aknill should occur within a maximum of 7 days of the prescription. Male patients : The available data suggest that the level of maternal exposure from the semen of the patients receiving Aknill, is not of a sufficient magnitude to be associated with the teratogenic effects of Aknill. Male patients should be reminded that they must not share their medication with anyone, particularly not females. Additional precautions : Patients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person, and to return any unused capsules to their pharmacist at the end of treatment. Patients should not donate blood during therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation of Aknill because of the potential risk to the foetus of a pregnant transfusion recipient. Psychiatric disorders : Depression, depression aggravated, anxiety, aggressive tendencies, mood alterations, psychotic symptoms, and very rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and suicide have been reported in patients treated with Aknill. Particular care needs to be taken in patients with a history of depression and all patients should be monitored for signs of depression and referred for appropriate treatment if necessary. However, discontinuation of Aknill may be insufficient to alleviate symptoms and therefore further psychiatric or psychological evaluation may be necessary. Skin and subcutaneous tissues disorders : Acute exacerbation of acne is occasionally seen during the initial period but this subsides with continued treatment, usually within 7-10 days, and usually does not require dose adjustment. Exposure to intense sunlight or to UV rays should be avoided. Where necessary a sun-protection product with a high protection factor of at least SPF 15 should be used. Aggressive chemical dermabrasion and cutaneous laser treatment should be avoided in patients on Aknill for a period of 5-6 months after the end of the treatment because of the risk of hypertrophic scarring in atypical areas and more rarely post inflammatory hyper or hypopigmentation in treated areas. Wax depilation should be avoided in patients on Aknill for at least a period of 6 months after treatment because of the risk of epidermal stripping. Concurrent administration of Aknill with topical keratolytic or exfoliative anti-acne agents should be avoided as local irritation may increase. Patients should be advised to use a skin moisturising ointment or cream and a lip balm from the start of treatment as Aknill is likely to cause dryness of the skin and lips. There have been post-marketing reports of severe skin reactions (e.g. erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)) associated with Aknill use. As these events may be difficult to distinguish from other skin reactions that may occur, patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for severe skin reactions. If a severe skin reaction is suspected, Aknill treatment should be discontinued. Allergic reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been rarely reported, in some cases after previous topical exposure to retinoids. Allergic cutaneous reactions are reported infrequently. Serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement have been reported. Severe allergic reactions necessitate interruption of therapy and careful monitoring. Eye disorders : Dry eyes, corneal opacities, decreased night vision and keratitis usually resolve after discontinuation of therapy. Dry eyes can be helped by the application of a lubricating eye ointment or by the application of tear replacement therapy. Intolerance to contact lenses may occur which may necessitate the patient to wear glasses during treatment. Decreased night vision has also been reported and the onset in some patients was sudden. Withdrawal of Aknill may be necessary. Musculo-skeletal and connective tissue disorders : Myalgia, arthralgia and increased serum creatine phosphokinase values have been reported in patients receiving Aknill, particularly in those undertaking vigorous physical activity. Bone changes including premature epiphyseal closure, hyperostosis, and calcification of tendons and ligaments have occurred after several years of administration at very high doses for treating disorders of keratinisation. The dose levels, duration of treatment and total cumulative dose in these patients generally far exceeded those recommended for the treatment of acne. Benign intracranial hypertension : Cases of benign intracranial hypertension have been reported, some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Signs and symptoms of benign intracranial hypertension include headache, nausea and vomiting, visual disturbances and papilloedema. Patients who develop benign intracranial hypertension should discontinue Aknill immediately. Hepatobiliary disorders : Liver enzymes should be checked before treatment, 1 month after the start of treatment, and subsequently at 3 monthly intervals unless more frequent monitoring is clinically indicated. Transient and reversible increases in liver transaminases have been reported. In many cases these changes have been within the normal range and values have returned to baseline levels during treatment. However, in the event of persistent clinically relevant elevation of transaminase levels, reduction of the dose or discontinuation of treatment should be considered. Renal insufficiency : Renal insufficiency and renal failure do not affect the pharmacokinetics of Aknill. Therefore, Aknill can be given to patients with renal insufficiency. However, it is recommended that patients are started on a low dose and titrated up to the maximum tolerated dose. Lipid Metabolism : Serum lipids (fasting values) should be checked before treatment, 1 month after the start of treatment, and subsequently at 3 monthly intervals unless more frequent monitoring is clinically indicated. Elevated serum lipid values usually return to normal on reduction of the dose or discontinuation of treatment and may also respond to dietary measures. Aknill has been associated with an increase in plasma triglyceride levels. Aknill should be discontinued if hypertriglyceridaemia cannot be controlled at an acceptable level or if symptoms of pancreatitis occur. Levels in excess of 800mg/dL or 9mmol/L are sometimes associated with acute pancreatitis, which may be fatal. Gastrointestinal disorders : Aknill has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. Patients experiencing severe (hemorrhagic) diarrhoea should discontinue Aknill immediately. High Risk Patients : In patients with diabetes, obesity, alcoholism or a lipid metabolism disorder undergoing treatment with Aknill, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids and/or blood glucose may be necessary. Elevated fasting blood sugars have been reported, and new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during Aknill therapy.",

The use of Naproxen in the first and third trimesters requires careful balancing of the benefits to the mother against the possible risks to the fetus. Naproxen is excreted in small amounts in the breast milk for nursing mothers.

This can be administered either directly in the mouth, or mixed with a spoonful of cold water or soft food at room temperature Use in the pediatric patient : The safety and efficacy of Montelukast have been established in adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric patients with asthma 6 months to 14 years of age. Safety and efficacy profiles in this age group are similar to those seen in adults. Hepatic Insufficiency : No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. Renal Insufficiency : No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency. Elderly use : The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.",
        "contraindications": "Montelukast is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product.",
        "side_effects": "Common : Diarrhoea, fever, gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin reactions, upper respiratory tract infection. Uncommon : Akathisia, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, abnormal behavior, depression, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, haemorrhage, irritability, malaise, muscle complaints, oedema, seizure, abnormal sensation, sleep disorders. Rare : Angioedema, concentration impaired, disorientation, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, erythema nodosum, hallucination, hepatic disorders, memory loss, palpitations, pulmonary eosinophilia, suicidal tendencies, tremor.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Montelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Montelukast is given to a nursing mother.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Airmont is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with Airmont can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, Airmont should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Airmont should not be used as monotherapy for the treatment and management of exercise induced bronchospasm. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking Airmont. Although Airmont is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients.",
        "overdose_effects": "There were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of Airmont and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required."

        "indications": "Aknill topical gel is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne vulgaris.",
        "pharmacology": "Isotretinoin produces its effects through altering progress through the cell cycle, cell differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. These actions reduce sebum production, preventing the blockage of pores, and growth of acne causing bacteria. Isotretinoin and 4-oxo-isotretinoin both significantly reduce the production of sebum. Isotretinoin has little to no affinity for retinol binding proteins (RBPs) and retinoic acid nuclear receptors (RARs). Tretinoin and 4-oxo-tretinion bind to the RAR-γ receptor, which is suspected to be part of the action of acne treatment by isotretinoin. Isotretinoin induces apoptosis in sebocytes, leading to a decrease in sebum production. Isotretinoin also reduces the formation of comedones by reducing hyperkeratinization through an unknown mechanism. Isotretinoin does not directly kill bacteria but it does reduce the size of sebum ducts and makes the microenvironment less hospitable to acne causing bacteria. It may also increase immune mechanisms and alter chemotaxis of monocytes to reduce inflammation.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Apply Isotretinoin 0.05% gel cautiously over the affected area once or twice daily. Patients should be advised that 6-8 weeks of treatment may be required before a therapeutic effect is observed. The safety and efficacy of Isotretinoin have not been established in children since acne vulgaris rarely present in this age group. There are no specific recommendations for use in the elderly. Acne vulgaris does not present in the elderly.",
        "contraindications": "Isotretinoin 0.05% gel is contra-indicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Isotretinoin.",
        "side_effects": "In normal use, Aknill may cause stinging, burning or irritation; erythema and peeling at the site of application may occur. If undue irritation occurs, treatment should be interrupted temporarily and resumed once the reaction subsides. If irritation persists, treatment should be discontinued. Reactions will normally resolve on discontinuation of therapy.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Pregnancy Category B. There is inadequate evidence of the safety of topically applied Isotretinoin in human pregnancy. Isotretinoin has been associated with teratogenicity in humans when administered systemically. Reproduction studies conducted in rabbits using Isotretinoin applied topically at up to 60 times the human dose have, however, revealed no harm to the foetus. The use of Isotretinoin should be avoided during pregnancy. Percutaneous absorption of Isotretinoin from Isotretinoin 0.05% gel is negligible. It is not known, however, whether Isotretinoin is excreted in human milk. Isotretinoin should not be used during lactation.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Contact with the mouth, eyes and mucous membranes and with abraded or eczematous skin should be avoided. Care should be taken not to let the medication accumulate in skin fold areas and in the angles of the nose. Application to sensitive areas of skin, such as the neck, should be made with caution. Although Tretinoin has not been shown to initiate or promote carcinogenesis in humans, Tretinoin applied topically to albino hairless mice had resulted in a dose-related acceleration in ultraviolet-B radiation induced cutaneous tumours. The same author also observed the opposite effect in another study of low, non-irritating concentrations of Tretinoin. The significance of these findings as related to man is unknown; however, caution should be observed in patients with a personal or family history of cutaneous epithelioma. Exposure to sunlight of areas treated with Aknill should be avoided or minimised. When exposure to strong sunlight cannot be avoided a sunscreen product and protective clothing should be used. Patients with sunburn should not use Aknill due to the possibility of increased sensitivity to sunlight. The use of sunlamps should be avoided during treatment.",
        "overdose_effects": "Acute overdosage of Aknill has not been reported to date. Accidental ingestion of Aknill resulting in overdosage of Aknill could be expected to induce symptoms of hypervitaminosis A. These include severe headaches, nausea or vomiting, drowsiness, irritability and pruritus."

Isotretinoin should only be prescribed by or under the supervision of physicians with expertise in the use of systemic retinoids for the treatment of severe acne and a full understanding of the risks of Isotretinoin therapy and monitoring requirements. Adults including adolescents and the elderly : Isotretinoin therapy should be started at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg daily. The therapeutic response to Isotretinoin and some of the adverse effects are dose-related and vary between patients. This necessitates individual dosage adjustment during therapy. For most patients, the dose ranges from 0.5-1.0 mg/kg per day. Long-term remission and relapse rates are more closely related to the total dose administered than to either duration of treatment or daily dose. It has been shown that no substantial additional benefit is to be expected beyond a cumulative treatment dose of 120-150 mg/kg. The duration of treatment will depend on the individual daily dose. A treatment course of 16-24 weeks is normally sufficient to achieve remission. In the majority of patients, complete clearing of the acne is obtained with a single treatment course. In the event of a definite relapse a further course of Isotretinoin therapy may be considered using the same daily dose and cumulative treatment dose. As further improvement of the acne can be observed up to 8 weeks after discontinuation of treatment, a further course of treatment should not be considered until at least this period has elapsed. Patients with severe renal insufficiency : In patients with severe renal insufficiency treatment should be started at a lower dose (e.g. 10 mg/day). The dose should then be increased up to 1 mg/kg/day or until the patient is receiving the maximum tolerated dose. Children : Isotretinoin is not indicated for the treatment of prepubertal acne and is not recommended in patients less than 12 years of age due to a lack of data on efficacy and safety. Patients with intolerance : In patients who show severe intolerance to the recommended dose, treatment may be continued at a lower dose with the consequences of a longer therapy duration and a higher risk of relapse. In order to achieve the maximum possible efficacy in these patients the dose should normally be continued at the highest tolerated dose.",

Overdose Aknill is a derivative of vitamin A. Although the acute toxicity of Aknill is low, signs of hypervitaminosis A could appear in cases of accidental overdose. Manifestations of acute vitamin A toxicity include severe headache, nausea or vomiting, drowsiness, irritability and pruritus. Signs and symptoms of accidental or deliberate overdosage with Aknill would probably be similar. These symptoms would be expected to be reversible and to subside without the need for treatment. Pharmaceutical precautions Store in a cool and dry place protected from light.",
        "pregnancy_and_lactation": "Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to treatment with Isotretinoin. If pregnancy does occur in spite of these precautions during treatment with Isotretinoin or in the month following, there is a great risk of very severe and serious malformation of the foetus. The foetal malformations associated with exposure to Isotretinoin include central nervous system abnormalities (hydrocephalus, cerebellar malformation/abnormalities, microcephaly), facial dysmorphia, cleft palate, external ear abnormalities (absence of external ear, small or absent external auditory canals), eye abnormalities (microphthalmia), cardiovascular abnormalities (conotruncal malformations such as tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of great vessels, septal defects), thymus gland abnormality and parathyroid gland abnormalities. There is also an increased incidence of spontaneous abortion. If pregnancy occurs in a woman treated with Isotretinoin, treatment must be stopped and the patient should be referred to a physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. Isotretinoin is highly lipophilic, therefore the passage of Isotretinoin into human milk is very likely. Due to the potential for adverse effects in the child exposed via mothers’ milk, the use of Isotretinoin is contraindicated in nursing mothers.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Contraception : Female patients must be provided with comprehensive information on pregnancy prevention and should be referred for contraceptive advice if they are not using effective contraception. As a minimum requirement, female patients at potential risk of pregnancy must use at least one effective method of contraception. Preferably the patient should use two complementary forms of contraception including a barrier method. Contraception should be continued for at least 1 month after stopping treatment with Aknill, even in patients with amenorrhea. Pregnancy testing : According to local practice, medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 25mIU/mL are recommended to be performed in the first 3 days of the menstrual cycle, as follows. Prior to starting therapy : In order to exclude the possibility of pregnancy prior to starting contraception, it is recommended that an initial medically supervised pregnancy test should be performed and its date and result recorded. In patients without regular menses, the timing of this pregnancy test should reflect the sexual activity of the patient and should be undertaken approximately 3 weeks after the patient last had unprotected sexual intercourse. The prescriber should educate the patient about contraception. A medically supervised pregnancy test should also be performed during the consultation when Aknill is prescribed or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber, and should have been delayed until the patient had been using effective contraception for at least 1 month. This test should ensure the patient is not pregnant when she starts treatment with Aknill. Follow-up visits : Follow-up visits should be arranged at 28 day intervals. The need for repeated medically supervised pregnancy tests every month should be determined according to local practice including consideration of the patient’s sexual activity and recent menstrual history (abnormal menses, missed periods or amenorrhea). Where indicated, follow-up pregnancy tests should be performed on the day of the prescribing visit or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber. End of treatment : Five weeks after stopping treatment, women should undergo a final pregnancy test to exclude pregnancy. Prescribing and dispensing restrictions : Prescriptions of Aknill for women of childbearing potential should be limited to 30 days of treatment and continuation of treatment requires a new prescription. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and dispensing of Aknill should occur on the same day. Dispensing of Aknill should occur within a maximum of 7 days of the prescription. Male patients : The available data suggest that the level of maternal exposure from the semen of the patients receiving Aknill, is not of a sufficient magnitude to be associated with the teratogenic effects of Aknill. Male patients should be reminded that they must not share their medication with anyone, particularly not females. Additional precautions : Patients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person, and to return any unused capsules to their pharmacist at the end of treatment. Patients should not donate blood during therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation of Aknill because of the potential risk to the foetus of a pregnant transfusion recipient. Psychiatric disorders : Depression, depression aggravated, anxiety, aggressive tendencies, mood alterations, psychotic symptoms, and very rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and suicide have been reported in patients treated with Aknill. Particular care needs to be taken in patients with a history of depression and all patients should be monitored for signs of depression and referred for appropriate treatment if necessary. However, discontinuation of Aknill may be insufficient to alleviate symptoms and therefore further psychiatric or psychological evaluation may be necessary. Skin and subcutaneous tissues disorders : Acute exacerbation of acne is occasionally seen during the initial period but this subsides with continued treatment, usually within 7-10 days, and usually does not require dose adjustment. Exposure to intense sunlight or to UV rays should be avoided. Where necessary a sun-protection product with a high protection factor of at least SPF 15 should be used. Aggressive chemical dermabrasion and cutaneous laser treatment should be avoided in patients on Aknill for a period of 5-6 months after the end of the treatment because of the risk of hypertrophic scarring in atypical areas and more rarely post inflammatory hyper or hypopigmentation in treated areas. Wax depilation should be avoided in patients on Aknill for at least a period of 6 months after treatment because of the risk of epidermal stripping. Concurrent administration of Aknill with topical keratolytic or exfoliative anti-acne agents should be avoided as local irritation may increase. Patients should be advised to use a skin moisturising ointment or cream and a lip balm from the start of treatment as Aknill is likely to cause dryness of the skin and lips. There have been post-marketing reports of severe skin reactions (e.g. erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)) associated with Aknill use. As these events may be difficult to distinguish from other skin reactions that may occur, patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms and monitored closely for severe skin reactions. If a severe skin reaction is suspected, Aknill treatment should be discontinued. Allergic reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been rarely reported, in some cases after previous topical exposure to retinoids. Allergic cutaneous reactions are reported infrequently. Serious cases of allergic vasculitis, often with purpura (bruises and red patches) of the extremities and extracutaneous involvement have been reported. Severe allergic reactions necessitate interruption of therapy and careful monitoring. Eye disorders : Dry eyes, corneal opacities, decreased night vision and keratitis usually resolve after discontinuation of therapy. Dry eyes can be helped by the application of a lubricating eye ointment or by the application of tear replacement therapy. Intolerance to contact lenses may occur which may necessitate the patient to wear glasses during treatment. Decreased night vision has also been reported and the onset in some patients was sudden. Withdrawal of Aknill may be necessary. Musculo-skeletal and connective tissue disorders : Myalgia, arthralgia and increased serum creatine phosphokinase values have been reported in patients receiving Aknill, particularly in those undertaking vigorous physical activity. Bone changes including premature epiphyseal closure, hyperostosis, and calcification of tendons and ligaments have occurred after several years of administration at very high doses for treating disorders of keratinisation. The dose levels, duration of treatment and total cumulative dose in these patients generally far exceeded those recommended for the treatment of acne. Benign intracranial hypertension : Cases of benign intracranial hypertension have been reported, some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines. Signs and symptoms of benign intracranial hypertension include headache, nausea and vomiting, visual disturbances and papilloedema. Patients who develop benign intracranial hypertension should discontinue Aknill immediately. Hepatobiliary disorders : Liver enzymes should be checked before treatment, 1 month after the start of treatment, and subsequently at 3 monthly intervals unless more frequent monitoring is clinically indicated. Transient and reversible increases in liver transaminases have been reported. In many cases these changes have been within the normal range and values have returned to baseline levels during treatment. However, in the event of persistent clinically relevant elevation of transaminase levels, reduction of the dose or discontinuation of treatment should be considered. Renal insufficiency : Renal insufficiency and renal failure do not affect the pharmacokinetics of Aknill. Therefore, Aknill can be given to patients with renal insufficiency. However, it is recommended that patients are started on a low dose and titrated up to the maximum tolerated dose. Lipid Metabolism : Serum lipids (fasting values) should be checked before treatment, 1 month after the start of treatment, and subsequently at 3 monthly intervals unless more frequent monitoring is clinically indicated. Elevated serum lipid values usually return to normal on reduction of the dose or discontinuation of treatment and may also respond to dietary measures. Aknill has been associated with an increase in plasma triglyceride levels. Aknill should be discontinued if hypertriglyceridaemia cannot be controlled at an acceptable level or if symptoms of pancreatitis occur. Levels in excess of 800mg/dL or 9mmol/L are sometimes associated with acute pancreatitis, which may be fatal. Gastrointestinal disorders : Aknill has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (including regional ileitis) in patients without a prior history of intestinal disorders. Patients experiencing severe (hemorrhagic) diarrhoea should discontinue Aknill immediately. High Risk Patients : In patients with diabetes, obesity, alcoholism or a lipid metabolism disorder undergoing treatment with Aknill, more frequent checks of serum values for lipids and/or blood glucose may be necessary. Elevated fasting blood sugars have been reported, and new cases of diabetes have been diagnosed during Aknill therapy.",

If the patient continues to experience symptoms after using this inhaler or requires more doses of this inhaler than usual, this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires evaluation of the patient and their treatment regimen. This inhaler can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with this inhaler, it should be discontinued immediately, and alternative therapy should be instituted. this inhaler, like other drugs containing beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or other symptoms. If such effects occur, this inhaler may need to be discontinued. As with other inhaled drugs containing beta-adrenergic agents, this inhaler should not be used more than the maximum daily as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Hypersensitivity reactions can occur after administration of salbutamol sulfate and budesonide, components of this inhaler, as demonstrated by cases of anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, oropharyngeal edema, rash, and urticaria. Discontinue this inhaler if such reactions occur. this inhaler, like all therapies containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders. hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines Beta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. Patients who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infection.

        "pharmacology": "Atorvastatin is a selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor of sterols, including cholesterol. Atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface for enhanced uptake and catabolism of LDL. Absorption : Atorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to Atorvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of Atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%. Distribution : Mean volume of distribution of Atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is 98% bound to plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based on observations in rats, Atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk. Metabolism : Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of Atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of Atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin in humans following coadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozymes. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation. Excretion : Atorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following hepatic and/or extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of Atorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of active metabolites. Less than 2% of a dose of Atorvastatin is recovered in urine following oral administration.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Primary hypercholesterolaemia and combined hyperlipidaemia- Adults : Usually 10 mg once daily; if necessary, may be increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to max. 80 mg once daily. Child (10-18 years) : Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 20 mg once daily. Familial hypercholesterolaemia- Adults : Initially 10 mg daily, increased at intervals of at least 4 weeks to 40 mg once daily; if necessary, further increased to max. 80 mg once daily (or 40 mg once daily combined with anion-exchange resin in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia). Child (10-18 years) : Initially 10 mg once daily, increased if necessary at intervals of at least 4 weeks to usual max. 80 mg once daily. Prevention of cardiovascular events- Adults : Initially 10 mg once daily adjusted according to response. Another guideline : The patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet before receiving Atorvastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment with Atorvastatin. The recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of Atorvastatin is 10 to 80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time of the day, with or without food. After initiation of Atorvastatin lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly. In hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10-17 years of age) the recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 mg/day; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day (doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more.",

        "pharmacology": "Albendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic. Albendazole exhibits vermicidal, ovicidal and larvicidal activities. The drug is thought to exert its anthelmintic effect by blocking glucose uptake in the susceptible helminths, thereby depleting the energy level until it becomes inadequate for survival. Immobilization is followed by the parasite. These events may be a consequence of the binding and subsequent inhibition of parasite tubulin polymerization by Albendazole and its metabolites, although the drug also binds to human tubulin. Albendazole is extensively metabolized, probably in the liver. Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but rapidly undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The principal metabolite albendazole sulphoxide has anthelmintic activity and a plasma half-life of about 8.5 hrs. It is excreted in the urine together with other metabolites.",

In cases of strongyloidiasis or taeniasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) daily should be given for 3 consecutive days. If the patient is not cured on follow-up after three weeks, a second course of treatment is indicated. Children of 1-2 years : Recommended dose is a single dose of 200 mg (5 ml suspension). Children under 1 year : Not recommended. In Hydatid disease (Echinococcosis) : Albendazole is given by mouth with meals in a dose of 400 mg twice daily for 28 days for patients weighing over 60 kg. A dose of 15 mg/kg body weight daily in two divided doses (to a maximum total daily dose of 800 mg) is used for patients weighing less than 60 kg. For cystic echinococcosis, the 28 days course may be repeated after 14 days without treatment, to a total of 3 treatment cycles. For alveolar echinococcosis, cycles of 28 days of treatment followed by 14 days without treatment, may need to continue for months or years. In giardiasis, 400 mg (1 tablet or 10 ml suspension) once daily for five days is used.",

Experimental investigations in asthmatic subjects have shown that Ketotifen is as effective orally as a selective mast cell stabilizer administered by inhalation. Antihistamines were ineffective in those tests. The effectiveness of Ketotifen has been studied in long-term clinical trials. Asthma attacks were reduced in number, severity and duration and in some cases, the patients were completely freed from attacks. Progressive reduction of corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators was also possible. The prophylactic activity of Ketotifen may take several weeks to become fully established. Ketotifen will not abort established attacks of asthma.",

        "pharmacology": "The H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity.

        "pharmacology": "methylphenidate (MPH) has been shown to act as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), thereby increasing the presence of these neurotransmitters in the extraneuronal space and prolonging their action. There is a dose-related effect of psychostimulants on receptor stimulation, where higher doses are shown to increase norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) efflux throughout the brain which can result in impaired cognition and locomotor-activating effects. In contrast, low doses are found to selectively activate NE and DE neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex which is an area of the brain thought to play a prominent role in ADHD pathophysiology, thereby improving clinical efficacy and preventing side effects. The lower doses used to treat ADHD are not associated with the locomotor-activating effects associated with higher doses and instead reduce movement, impulsivity, and increase cognitive function including sustained attention and working memory. Methylphenidate's beneficial effects in sustaining attention have also been shown to be mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activity. Clinical findings have shown that children with ADHD have an abnormality in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), the D4 receptor gene (DRD-4), and/or the D2 receptor gene that may be at least partly overcome by the dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate, suggesting a possible mode of action.",

        "pharmacology": "Olopatadine, an antihistamine, works by blocking the action of histamine in the body, which reduces allergy symptoms. Olopatadine hydrochloride treats sneezing, itching, runny nose, and other nasal symptoms of allergies. Mode of Action : Olopatadine is an anti-allergic molecule that works via several mechanisms. As a mast cell stabilizer, it stabilizes rodent basophils and human conjunctival mast cells and inhibits the immunologically-stimulated release of histamine. Olopatadine acts as an antagonist at the histamine H1 receptors with high selectivity, Upon binding, olopatadine blocks the H1 receptor signaling pathway, inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators, such as tryptase, prostaglandin D2, TNF-alpha, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pharmacokinetics : Absorption: Olopatadine was absorbed with individual peak plasma concentrations observed between 30 minutes and 1 hour after twice daily intranasal administration of Olopatadine Nasal Spray. Distribution: The protein binding of olopatadine was moderate at approximately 55% in human serum, and independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.1 to 1000 ng/mL. Metabolism: Olopatadine is not extensively metabolized. Based on plasma metabolite profiles of olopatadine, at least six minor metabolites circulate in human plasma.

        "pharmacology": "Valacyclovir is the hydrochloride salt of L-valyl ester of the antiviral drug acyclovir. Valacyclovir is an antiviral drug. It slows the growth and spread of the herpes virus so that the body can fight off the infection. Valacyclovir lessens the symptoms of infections and shortens the length of time of sickness. Valacyclovir is used in the treatment and suppression of genital herpes, shingles and cold sores.",
        "dosage_and_administration": "Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections- herpes zoster : Patients should be advised to start treatment as soon as possible after a diagnosis of herpes zoster. There are no data on treatment started more than 72 hours after onset of the zoster rash. Immunocompetent Adults: The dose in immunocompetent patients is Valacyclovir 1000mg (1 Valacyclovir 1000mg tablet) three times daily for 7 days (3000mg total daily dose). Immunocompromised Adults : The dose in immunocompromised patients is Valacyclovir 1000mg (1 Valacyclovir 1000mg tablet) 3 times daily for at least 7 days (3000mg total daily dose) and for 2 days following crusting of lesions. In immunocompromised patients, antiviral treatment is suggested for patients presenting within one week of vesicle formation or at any time before full crusting of lesions. Treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in adults and adolescents (>12 years) : Immunocompetent Adults and Adolescents (³12 years): The dose is Valacyclovir 500mg (1 Valacyclovir 500mg tablet) to be taken twice daily (1000mg total daily dose). This dose should be reduced according to creatinine clearance. For recurrent episodes, treatment should be for 3 to 5 days. For initial episodes, which can be more severe, treatment may have to be extended to 10 days. Dosing should begin as early as possible. For recurrent episodes of herpes simplex, this should ideally be during the prodromal period or immediately upon appearance of the first signs or symptoms. Valacyclovir can prevent lesion development when taken at the first signs and symptoms of an HSV recurrence. Herpes labialis : For herpes labialis (cold sores), Valacyclovir 2000mg (2 Valacyclovir 1000mg tablet) twice daily for one day is effective treatment in adults and adolescents. The second dose should be taken about 12 h (no sooner than 6 h) after the first dose. This dose should be reduced according to creatinine clearance. When using this dosing regimen, treatment should not exceed one day, since this has been shown not to provide additional clinical benefit. Therapy should be initiated at the earliest symptom of a cold sore (e.g. tingling, itching or burning). Immunocompromised Adults : The dosage is Valacyclovir 1000mg (1 Valacyclovir 1000mg tablet) twice daily for at least 5 days, following assessment of the severity of the clinical condition and immunological status of the patient. For initial episodes, which can be more severe, treatment may have to be extended to ten days. Dosing should begin as early as possible. This dose should be reduced according to creatinine clearance. For maximum clinical benefit, the treatment should be started within 48 hours. A strict monitoring of the evolution of lesions is advised.Suppression of recurrences of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in adults and adolescents (12 years) Immunocompetent Adults and Adolescents (12 years) : The dose is Valacyclovir 500mg (1 Valacyclovir 500mg tablet) to be taken once daily. Some patients with very frequent recurrences (10/year in absence of therapy) may gain additional benefit from the daily dose of Valacyclovir 500mg (1 Valacyclovir 500mg tablet) being taken as a divided dose (250mg twice daily). Treatment should be re-evaluated after 6 to 12 months of therapy. Immunocompromised Adults : The dose is Valacyclovir 500mg (1 Valacyclovir 500mg tablet) twice daily. Treatment should be re-evaluated after 6 to 12 months of therapy. Prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in adults and adolescents (12 years) The dosage of Valacyclovir is 2000mg (2 Valacyclovir 1000 mg tablet) four times a day, to be initiated as early as possible post-transplant. This dose should be reduced according to creatinine clearance.The duration of treatment will usually be 90 days, but may need to be extended in high-risk patients.",
        "contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to Valacyclovir or aciclovir or any of the excipients.",
        "side_effects": "The most common side effects reported in at least one indication by patients treated with Alaclov in clinical trials were headache and nausea. Other side effects include: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, Leucopenia is mainly reported in immunocompromised patients. Immune system disorders: Anaphylaxis. Psychiatric and nervous system disorders: Dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, decreased concentrations, tremor, agitation, ataxia, dysarthria, convulsions, encephalopathy, coma, psychotic symptoms. Respiratory disorders: Dyspnea. Gastrointestinal disorders: Vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort. Hepato-biliary disorders: Reversible increases in liver function tests. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rashes including photosensitivity, pruritus, urticaria. Renal system disorders: Renal pain, renal impairment (especially in elderly patients or in patients with renal impairment receiving higher than the recommended doses). Renal pain may be associated with renal failure.",

Animal studies do not show reproductive toxicity for Valacyclovir. Valacyclovir should only be used in pregnancy if the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the potential risk. Use in lactation: Aciclovir, the principle metabolite of Valacyclovir, is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses of Valacyclovir, no effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated since the dose ingested by the child is less than 2% of the therapeutic dose of intravenous aciclovir for treatment of neonatal herpes. Valacyclovir should be used with caution during breast feeding and only when clinically indicated.",
        "precautions_and_warnings": "Hydration status : Care should be taken to ensure adequate fluid intake in patients who are at risk of dehydration, particularly the elderly. Use in patients with renal impairment and in elderly patients : Aciclovir is eliminated by renal clearance; therefore the dose of Alaclov must be reduced in patients with renal impairment. Elderly patients are likely to have reduced renal function and therefore the need for dose reduction must be considered in this group of patients. Both elderly patients and patients with renal impairment are at increased risk of developing neurological side-effects and should be closely monitored for evidence of these effects. In the reported cases, these reactions were generally reversible on discontinuation of treatment. Use of higher dose of Alaclov in hepatic impairment and liver transplantation : There are no data available on the use of higher doses of Alaclov (4000mg or more per day) in patients with liver disease. Specific studies of Alaclov have not been conducted in liver transplantation, and hence caution should be exercised when administering daily doses greater than 4000mg to these patients. Use for zoster treatment : Clinical response should be closely monitored, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Consideration should be given to intravenous antiviral therapy when response to oral therapy is considered insufficient. Patients with complicated herpes zoster, i.e. those with visceral involvement, disseminated zoster, motor neuropathies, encephalitis and cerebrovascular complications should be treated with intravenous antiviral therapy. Moreover, immunocom-promised patients with ophthalmic zoster or those with a high risk for disease dissemination and visceral organ involvement should be treated with intravenous antiviral therapy. Transmission of genital herpes : Patients should be advised to avoid intercourse when symptoms are present even if treatment with an antiviral has been initiated. Use of ocular HSV infections : Clinical response should be closely monitored in these patients. Consideration should be given to intravenous antiviral therapy when response to oral therapy is unlikely to be sufficient. Use in CMV infections : Data on the efficacy of Alaclov from transplant patients at high risk of CMV disease indicate that Alaclov should only be used in these patients when safety concerns preclude the use of valganciclovir or ganciclovir. High dose Alaclov as required for CMV prophylaxis may result in more frequent adverse events than observed with lower doses administered for other indications. Patients should be closely monitored for changes in renal function, and doses adjusted accordingly.",
        "overdose_effects": "Acute renal failure and neurological symptoms, including confusion, hallucinations, agitation, decreased consciousness and coma have been reported in patients receiving overdoses of Alaclov. Nausea and vomiting may also occur. Caution is required to prevent inadvertent overdosing. Many of the reported cases involved renally impaired and elderly patients receiving repeated overdoses, due to lack of appropriate dosage reduction. Patients should be observed closely for signs of toxicity. Hemodialysis significantly enhances the removal of aciclovir from the blood and may, therefore, be considered a management option in the event of symptomatic overdose."

Ketotifen exerts as sustained inhibitory effect on histamine reactions, which can be clearly dissociated from its anti-anaphylactic properties. Experimental investigations in asthmatic subjects have shown that Ketotifen is as effective orally as a selective mast cell stabilizer administered by inhalation. Antihistamines were ineffective in those tests. The effectiveness of Ketotifen has been studied in long-term clinical trials. Asthma attacks were reduced in number, severity and duration and in some cases, the patients were completely freed from attacks.

Alafree improves health-related quality of life and work/activity productivity.",
        "pharmacology": "The H1 histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to allergen results in the degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H1 receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine is considered an \"inverse agonist\" of the H1 receptor because it binds to and stabilizes the inactive form of the receptor, preventing its activation and subsequent downstream effects. It has a potent and selective affinity for H1 receptors, and there is no evidence that it carries antidopaminergic, antiserotonergic, anticholinergic, sedative, or adrenergic blocking activity.
